Those admitted into the program will take general education, biology, and other science courses during their first three years at ETSU that will prepare them for admission into the Gatton College of Pharmacy (GCOP). Upon successful completion of the required first year pharmacy courses, the student will receive a BS in Biology through the Interdisciplinary Biology Track. Admission Requirements Students in the 3 + 1 degree program must meet admission requirements and apply to the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program following the normal application process as detailed on the College of Pharmacy webpage ( https://www.etsu.edu/pharmacy/prospective_students/default.php ). Students may be in the process of completing pharmacy pre-requisite courses at the time of application, but must do so by the end of the spring semester preceding matriculation in the fall semester. Students will be encouraged to apply as Early Decision applicants, the deadline for which is the first Monday of September for the admission cycle (July 1-March 1). This assures students will receive an admission offer by mid-October, which will facilitate their ability to implement an alternate plan should the decision be negative. Advising Students pursuing the 3 + 1 degree option will be advised through the normal advising process for Biological Science Majors. The GCOP Assistant Director for Enrollment will provide secondary advisement relative to preparation for pharmacy school. The GCOP advisor will meet with students each semester; the intent is to provide students with on-going assessment of their likelihood for admission to GCOP. In addition, students will be encouraged to participate in the ETSU Pre Pharmacy Student Organization, advised by a GCOP faculty member. Students deemed non-competitive for admission to GCOP will be referred to Biological Sciences major advisors to develop an alternate plan to earn the BS in Biology degree. 3+1 Biology and Pharmacy Program Requirements: 120 credits Compass Core Curriculum 42 credits Biology Major Core 17 credits Biology Interdisciplinary Track 18 credits Non-biology Course Requirements 21-23 credits Free Electives 2-4 credits Pharmacy Year 1 Requirements 18 credits TOTAL 120 credits Suggested Four-Year Program of Study: 3 + 1 Biology and Pharmacy Program Compass Core Curriculum These requirements include earning 40-43 credits in Strengthening Foundations, Understanding Natural and Social Worlds, Exploring Connections, Cultivate Artistic Awareness, and Growing as an Individual and Global Citizen categories.

        "document_content": "Program Information The 3+1 Chemistry and Pharmacy Program allows students to complete a BS in Chemistry while also starting study toward the Doctor of Pharmacy. Those admitted into the program will take general education, chemistry, and other science courses during their first three years at ETSU that will prepare them for admission into the Gatton College of Pharmacy. Upon successful completion of the required first year pharmacy courses, the student will receive a BS in Chemistry (Chemistry Concentration). Admission Requirements Students in the 3+1 degree program must meet admission requirements for and apply to the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program following the normal application process as detailed on the College of Pharmacy webpage ( https://www.etsu.edu/pharmacy/prospective_students/ ). Students may be in the process of completing pharmacy prerequisite courses at the time of application, but must complete them by the end of the spring semester preceding matriculation in the fall semester. Students will be encouraged to apply for Early Decision, the deadline for which is the first Monday of September for the admission cycle (July 1-March 1). Thisassures students will receive an admissions decision by mid-October, which will facilitate their ability to implement an alternative plan should the decision be negative. Advising Students pursuing the 3+1 degree option will be advised through the normal advising process for Chemistry majors. The GCOP Assistant Director for Enrollment will providesecondary advisement relative to preparation for pharmacy school. The GCOP advisor will meet with students each semester; the intent is to provide students with ongoing assessment of their likelihood for admission to GCOP. In addition, students will be encouraged to participate in the ETSU Pre-Pharmacy Student Organization, advised by a GCOP faculty member. Students deemed non-competitive for admission to GCOP will be referred to Chemistry major advisors to develop an alternative plan to earn the B.S. in Chemistry degree. 3+1 Chemistry and Pharmacy Program Requirements: 120 credits Compass Core Curriculum 42 credits Chemistry Major Core 14 credits Concentration Requirements 11 credits Additional Required Courses 8-10 credits Free Electives 1-4 credits 3+1 Pre-Pharmacy Requirements 19-20 credits Pharmacy Year 1 Requirements 22 credits TOTAL 120 credits Suggested Four-Year Program of Study: 3 + 1 Chemistry and Pharmacy Program Compass Core Curriculum These requirements include earning 40-43 credits in Strengthening Foundations, Understanding Natural and Social Worlds, Exploring Connections, Cultivate Artistic Awareness, and Growing as an Individual and Global Citizen categories.

One class per year is admitted in the fall. Students are required to attend designated consecutive semesters to complete the program. Successful completion of the program enables students to take the National Board Exam for Dental Hygiene and clinical board exams as required for licensure leading to the credentials of Registered Dental Hygienist. The dental hygienist works with the dental team in the prevention and control of dental disease and has the opportunity to work in diverse settings. In addition to the private dental office, dental hygienists may work in such practice settings as: federal, state, and local health departments, hospitals, nursing homes, school systems, educational programs for dental hygiene and dental assisting students, private business/industry, correctional facilities, private and public centers for pediatric, geriatric, and other individuals/groups with special needs, and health maintenance organizations. The dental hygienist, a recognized member of the dental team, is devoted to helping patients prevent dental disease and maintain good oral health. The responsibilities of a licensed dental hygienist in Tennessee include scaling and polishing teeth, applying topical fluoride agents, placing pit and fissure sealants, providing nutritional counseling, exposing and processing dental radiographs, and educating the patient in the proper care of their teeth and supporting structures.Admission- Students must be admitted both to the university and to the program, requiring separate application processes. Admission to the university does not ensure admission to the program. Application to the dental hygiene program requires submission of the onlineapplication formand submission of all college transcripts to the program. Completed application materials must be received by March 1.The dental hygiene program at East Tennessee State University is participating in the American Dental Education Association Dental Hygiene Centralized Application Service (ADEA DHCAS).Applicants applying to the entry level Bachelor of Science program will apply online using the ADEA DHCAS application. To learn more about ADEA DHCAS, please visitwww.adea.org/dhcas.Expenses: In addition to the usual registration and tuition, students are required to purchase such personal items as uniforms, dental instruments, specialized textbooks, laboratory materials, and specialized equipment. Expenditures for these items, which are the personal property of the student, are approximately $5,000. Most of this additional expense occurs during the first year of study.Retention - Progression Policy:Dental Hygiene students will be allowed to progress in the dental hygiene curriculum as all dental hygiene courses and basic science courses (Anatomy and Physiology, Microbiology, and Chemistry) are completed with a grade of C- or better. Progression status will be evaluated at the close of each semester. Students receiving less than a C- in any of the classes listed above will be placed on probation. A student on probation who receives a second grade of less than C- in one of the classes listed above will not be permitted to progress in the dental hygiene curriculum. Students earning a failing gradein any dental hygiene course will be reviewed by the faculty to determine feasibility of progression. Following the faculty review of student performance, an individual plan for curriculum completion will be presented for consideration for any student affected. Dental Hygiene Major, B.S.D.H."

An undergraduate major is offered in Elementary Education, and students may choose to take coursework that leads to a dual license in Elementary Education (K-5) as well as PreK-12 English as a Second Language. The Department also offers the courses required for licensure in fields of secondary education and K-12 teacher education at the undergraduate level.Teacher Licensure Progression:Students wishing to pursue a course of study leading to an Elementary Education (K-5) teacher licensure may declare the major at any time. When declared, the student is admitted into the teacher licensure program after they have met the 2.75 GPA and background check requirement. The teacher candidate then proceeds through the established program of study meeting the detailed progression requirements in order to proceed. Failure to meet the established progression requirements will prevent a student from moving forward toward completing the degree/licensure. Each student will be advised throughout their program of study by either an advisor in the Clemmer College Office of Student Success or a faculty advisor in the department of the major.

It is a fundamental science for humans to appreciate, understand, and utilize in order to have a functioning society.The department offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Geosciences. This degree program brings together depth and breadth of Geosciences and does so by offering four concentrations: Geospatial Science, Paleontology, Geology & Environment, and Geography and Sustainability. Geospatial science is an applied science taught throughout all the concentrations and is found to be highly beneficial in obtaining employment, be it in geosciences, urban planning, public health, anthropology, sociology, engineering, or among a host of federal and state government agencies.The study of earths geology related to environment is taught in the concentration, Geology & Environment. It applies knowledge of geology in solving environmental problems occurring due to natural and human induced hazards. Graduates from Geology and Environment work for consulting industries, state and local government agencies such as geological surveys, department of transportation, and department of environment and conservation.ETSUs graduates in the geosciences with a good background in geospatial sciences and geology and environment typically obtain jobs right after graduation.

Admission to the Doctor of Pharmacy Degree (PharmD) at the Gatton College of Pharmacy (GCOP) requires at least two years of undergraduate studies.Approximately half of all students admitted to Gatton College of Pharmacy (GCOP) matriculate with an undergraduate degree.The 3 + 1 B.S. in Health Sciences option would allow students to complete the requirements for a B.S. in Health Sciences while enrolled in the PharmD program at GCOP.The U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates positive employmentgrowth for pharmacists over the next ten years with an expected increase nationally of sixteen percent and Tennessee should increasegrowth by approximately seven percent. Advising Dara Young (423) 439-4458 Email: youngdc@etsu.edu Website: https://www.etsu.edu/cph/faculty/youngdc.php Admission Requirements Students in the 3 + 1 degree program must meet admission requirements and apply to the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program following the normal application process as detailed on the College of Pharmacy webpage https://www.etsu.edu/pharmacy/prospective_students/default.php ). Students may be in the process of completing pharmacy prerequisite courses at the time of application, but must do so by the end of the spring semester preceding matriculation in the fall semester. Students will be encouraged to apply as Early Decision applicants, the deadline for which is the first Monday of September for the admission cycle (July 1-March 1). This assures students will receive an admission decision by mid-October, which will facilitate their ability to implement an alternate plan should the decision be negative. Advising Students pursuing the 3 + 1 degree option will be advised through the normal advising process for Health Science departmental majors. The GCOP Assistant Director for Enrollment will provide secondary advisement relative to preparation for pharmacy school. The GCOP advisor will meet with students each semester; the intent is to provide students with on-going assessment of their likelihood for admission to GCOP. In addition, students will be encouraged to participate in the ETSU Pre-Pharmacy Student Organization, advised by a GCOP faculty member. Students deemed non-competitive for admission to GCOP will be referred to Health Sciences major advisors to develop an alternate plan to earn the B.S. Health Sciences degree. 3 + 1 Biology and Pharmacy Program Requirements: 120 credits Compass Core Curriculum 41 credits Major Requirements 79 credits Major Core (38 credits) Advisor Approved Electives 23+18 credits TOTAL 120 credits Suggested Four-Year Program of Study: 3 + 1 Health Sciences and Pharmacy Program Compass Core Curriculum These requirements include earning 40-43 credits in Strengthening Foundations, Understanding Natural and Social Worlds, Exploring Connections, Cultivate Artistic Awareness, and Growing as an Individual and Global Citizen categories.

See Reinstatement/Reentry/Readmission Process in the BSN Student Handbook.Exceptions to this policy include leave for required military duty and unexpected severe illness or injury with medical documentation.Reinstatement/Reentry/Readmission ProcessReinstatement:Reinstatement is the process used for students who take an approved LOA for one semester. Students approved for an LOA and who are in good standing are eligible for reinstatement. Students should submit a Request for Reinstatement Form by the deadline to ensure timely program reinstatement. After the Request for Reinstatement Form is reviewed by the Assistant Dean for Student Services and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs, students will be reenrolled in the semester of nursing courses from which they withdrew during the next available semester. If a students original site does not offer the semester of courses the student needs, the student can submit in writing to the Assistant Dean for Student Services and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs a request for a one-time transfer to the site where courses are offered. Students who are granted a site transfer must remain enrolled at the site for the remainder of the curriculum.Reentry:Reentry is the process used for students who withdraw from the nursing program in good standing with the University and the College of Nursing. Decisions about program reentry are considered on an individual- and space-available basis in consultation with the Assistant Dean of Student Services and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. Students who wish to be considered for program reentry should submit a letter outlining their plan requesting enrollment in desired semester courses to the Assistant Dean of Student Services and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. In most cases, decisions related to program reentry will not be finalized until after final semester grades from the prior semester are published. Under no circumstance will a student requesting reentry be permitted to displace a currently enrolled student who is in sequence for progression. Students who are approved for program reentry are required to work with the appropriate Program Director to develop an Individualized Reentry Plan (IRP) to identify gaps in knowledge and demonstrate competency prior to enrolling in the requested semester. Failure to comply with or complete the IRP will result in permanent program dismissal.Readmission:Readmission is the process used for students who are academically dismissed from the program. Students may be readmitted to the nursing major only once. Students may be required to reapply to the University. Students may be required to reapply to the Undergraduate Program and, if so, will have their application materials considered in conjunction with the other pool of applicants for the admission cycle. Students who are readmitted may be required to take additional course work prior to or concurrent with readmission. Students dismissed for behavioral issues are ineligible for readmission.Students who desire to be considered for program readmission after academic dismissal should submit a Request for Readmission Form.Students who are readmitted will:Remain on probationary status for the duration of the program.Meet with the Program Director and the appropriate Office of Student Services Advisor to develop an individualized Undergraduate Academic Success Plan (UASP).Sign and comply with the UASP.NOTE: Failure to agree, sign, and/or comply with the conditions established in the UASP will result in a permanent program dismissal.Criminal Background ChecksTo progress clinically, students will be required to complete a Criminal Background Check at his or her own expense from a specified vendor. Unfavorable results may result in a students inability to continue in clinical courses; review of the contents of the background check and the determination for eligibility for participation at a clinical site will be conducted by affiliated clinical agencies. Although the College of Nursing does not receive the contents of the background check, documentation of completion is kept with the students Clinical Course Health Requirement file.Admissions Requirements and Curricula by Program TrackTraditional BSN Program:https://www.etsu.edu/nursing/default.phpLPN-BSN Program:https://www.etsu.edu/nursing/undergrad/default.phpRN-BSN Program:https://www.etsu.edu/nursing/undergrad/default.phpDual Degree RN-BSN:https://www.etsu.edu/nursing/undergrad/default.php Nursing Major, B.S.N."

Applicants must earn a \u201cC\u201d or better in all pre-requisite courses. Pre-requisites with a grade of \u201cC-\u201d or below may be repeated only once to earn a \u201cC\u201d or better. If repeated, the most recent letter grade will be used in the pre-requisite GPA calculation. Courses with grades of W (withdrawal), and WF (withdrawal fail) will be considered as unsuccessful attempts.Anatomy and Physiology 1 with Lab (4 credits)Anatomy and Physiology 2 with Lab (4 credits)Introduction to Microbiology with Lab (4 credits)Probability and Statistics (3 credits)Transfer students are responsible for making sure courses taken at other institutions are equivalent to ETSU General Education courses. For further information about transfer equivalency, go to:https://www.etsu.edu/general-education/Acceptance of transfer and substitute credits in nursing to meet the requirement of the curriculum will be reviewed and determined by the nursing faculty in conjunction with the Office of Student Services (OSS). Students seeking to transfer into the BSN program must meet the same admission requirements as other applicants and provide a letter of good standing from their prior nursing program.Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA):A minimum cumulative college level Grade Point Average (GPA) of 3.0 as computed by East Tennessee State University (excluding developmental coursework) is required.Pre-Requisite GPA:A minimum pre-requisite (GPA) of 2.75 is required. Pre-requisite courses must be completed within 5 years of admission to the nursing program.Standardized Entrance Examination:Applicants must electronically submit all scores from the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS).

Applicants can take the TEAS exam a maximum of two (2) times with a minimum 30-day waiting period requirement between attempts to allow applicants to engage in remediation.*LPN-BSN students who have taken the TEAS exam within the past two (2) years as part of their admission to their LPN program may submit the results as part of their application for the LPN-BSN program. Students are encouraged to pay close attention to the minimum score requirement as stated above.Nursing Program Orientation:Nursing program orientation ismandatory. Students are required to be present for theentireorientation. Nursing orientation is usually held 1-2 weeks prior to the start of each semester. Dates for orientation are provided with the notification of acceptance.*Requests for missing in-person orientation are considered on a case-by-case basis under extraordinary circumstances as defined in the BSN Student Handbook. Make-up orientation will be required.NOTE: Failure to meet all the above admission requirements (1-5) will result in forfeiture of admission to the nursing program.NOTE: Applicants who are admitted to ETSU as freshman with a high school GPA of 3.5 or above, ACT cumulative score of 29 or above, and maintain an ETSU overall GPA of 3.2 or higher,will be guaranteed admission to the nursing major. Students must complete the College of Nursing application process and meet all other established admissions criteria.Progression PolicyProgression Guidelines for UndergraduatesNursing courses must be taken in sequence as indicated by the plan of study.All students in the nursing major must earn a minimum grade of \u201cC\u201d in each required didactic and/or clinical nursing course.Students must achieve an overall average of 75% on all exams (content and final) within a didactic course to pass the course. Points for course assignments other than exams (i.e., quizzes, class assignments, group work) are not calculated into the course grade until the 75% benchmark on exams is attained. Once the 75% benchmark is reached, any additional points earned will be applied to calculate the final course grade. If a student fails to achieve an overall exam average of 75%, the student will receive the letter grade equivalent to the average of the exam scores.NOTE: Final course points, not percentages, will be rounded to the whole number. Totals ending with 0.5 or higher will round up to the whole number. Totals ending with less than 0.5 will not be rounded.Students who are unsuccessful in or withdraw (W) from one nursing course are permitted to repeat the course at the next available offering and space permitting. Courses may not be offered every semester and/or at every location and/or clinical facility. Students repeating a clinical course may be required to travel or take a leave of absence until clinical space is available. Costs incurred with travel are the responsibility of the student.NOTE: Students who withdraw (W) from a course with a designated co-requisite must withdraw from both.Students who are unsuccessful in two or more required nursing courses, in either the same semester or subsequent semesters, are automatically dismissed from the College of Nursing. Unsuccessful completion includes:Grades lower than a \u201cC\u201d and/orWithdrawal Failing (WF)Students who withdraw (W) from one or more nursing courses two or more times during the program of study are automatically dismissed from the College of Nursing.Students who do not maintain an overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher will be dismissed from the College of Nursing.Students who find it necessary to withdraw (W) from an entire semester of nursing courses must apply for a Leave of Absence (LOA). Students who withdraw (W) from an entire semester of nursing courses without applying for a Leave of Absence (LOA) are considered as relinquishing their placement in the program and are automatically dismissed from the College of Nursing.Leave of AbsenceStudents who need to withdraw from an entire semester of nursing courses are required to apply for a leave of absence (LOA). LOAs are not encouraged, but sometimes necessary. Students should work with their advisor and submit the Leave of Absence Request Form. Students can request a LOA only once during their curriculum. LOAs extend only for one semester. Students who intend to return after a LOA will complete a Request for Reinstatement Form. Failure to submit the Request for Reinstatement Form is considered relinquishment of position in the program and the student will be dismissed from the program.Students who find it necessary to be absent for longer than one semester are required to withdraw from the nursing program and, if in good standing with the University and the College of Nursing, may be considered for reentry to the nursing program. See Reinstatement/Reentry/Readmission Process in the BSN Student Handbook.Exceptions to this policy include leave for required military duty and unexpected severe illness or injury with medical documentation.Reinstatement/Reentry/Readmission ProcessReinstatement:Reinstatement is the process used for students who take an approved LOA for one semester. Students approved for an LOA and who are in good standing are eligible for reinstatement. Students should submit a Request for Reinstatement Form by the deadline to ensure timely program reinstatement. After the Request for Reinstatement Form is reviewed by the Assistant Dean for Student Services and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs, students will be reenrolled in the semester of nursing courses from which they withdrew during the next available semester. If a students original site does not offer the semester of courses the student needs, the student can submit in writing to the Assistant Dean for Student Services and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs a request for a one-time transfer to the site where courses are offered. Students who are granted a site transfer must remain enrolled at the site for the remainder of the curriculum.Reentry:Reentry is the process used for students who withdraw from the nursing program in good standing with the University and the College of Nursing. Decisions about program reentry are considered on an individual- and space-available basis in consultation with the Assistant Dean of Student Services and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. Students who wish to be considered for program reentry should submit a letter outlining their plan requesting enrollment in desired semester courses to the Assistant Dean of Student Services and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. In most cases, decisions related to program reentry will not be finalized until after final semester grades from the prior semester are published. Under no circumstance will a student requesting reentry be permitted to displace a currently enrolled student who is in sequence for progression. Students who are approved for program reentry are required to work with the appropriate Program Director to develop an Individualized Reentry Plan (IRP) to identify gaps in knowledge and demonstrate competency prior to enrolling in the requested semester. Failure to comply with or complete the IRP will result in permanent program dismissal.Readmission:Readmission is the process used for students who are academically dismissed from the program. Students may be readmitted to the nursing major only once. Students may be required to reapply to the University. Students may be required to reapply to the Undergraduate Program and, if so, will have their application materials considered in conjunction with the other pool of applicants for the admission cycle. Students who are readmitted may be required to take additional course work prior to or concurrent with readmission. Students dismissed for behavioral issues are ineligible for readmission.Students who desire to be considered for program readmission after academic dismissal should submit a Request for Readmission Form.Students who are readmitted will:Remain on probationary status for the duration of the program.Meet with the Program Director and the appropriate Office of Student Services Advisor to develop an individualized Undergraduate Academic Success Plan (UASP).Sign and comply with the UASP.NOTE: Failure to agree, sign, and/or comply with the conditions established in the UASP will result in a permanent program dismissal.Criminal Background ChecksTo progress clinically, students will be required to complete a Criminal Background Check at his or her own expense from a specified vendor. Unfavorable results may result in a students inability to continue in clinical courses; review of the contents of the background check and the determination for eligibility for participation at a clinical site will be conducted by affiliated clinical agencies. Although the College of Nursing does not receive the contents of the background check, documentation of completion is kept with the students Clinical Course Health Requirement file.Admissions Requirements and Curricula by Program TrackTraditional BSN Program:https://www.etsu.edu/nursing/default.phpLPN-BSN Program:https://www.etsu.edu/nursing/undergrad/default.phpRN-BSN Program:https://www.etsu.edu/nursing/undergrad/default.phpDual Degree RN-BSN:https://www.etsu.edu/nursing/undergrad/default.php Nursing Major, B.S.N."

One cohortper year is admitted in the fall semester, and students must then attend designated consecutive semesters to complete the program. Dietetics professionals work in health care settings where they apply scientific knowledge and skills to provide effective nutritional care of patients and clients in clinical and community settings. The dietetics practitioner uses critical thinking skills in assessing nutritional status of patients and providing evidenced-based nutrition care and medical nutrition therapy. Skillfulness in implementing nutrition interventions and monitoring the effectiveness of nutrition therapy is required at all levels of dietetics practice. The interdisciplinary health care team utilizes the expertise of the registered dietitian in planning, implementing, and evaluating nutrition therapy for patients with various disease conditions or in disease prevention. Dietetics professionals provide nutrition education and counseling to patients and clients, health coaching in out-patient settings, diabetes education and training, monitoring tube feedings or nutrition support for patients in critical care units, management of clinical nutrition departments or health care food service operations.Upon successful completion of the requirements for the nutrition program (didactic program in dietetics), students are eligible to apply for dietetic internships where they will perform 1000 hours of supervised practice in a variety of dietetics rotations. Once the supervised practice is successfully completed, the student will be eligible to sit for the Registration Examination for Dietitians (RD exam). Licensure requirements for registered dietitians vary according to state statutes, but all require a passing score on the RD exam. An option for students who delay or choose not to pursue the RD credential is taking the examination to become a registered dietetic technicianupon completion of requirements for the BS degree in nutrition.Admission:Students must be admitted both to the university and to the program, requiring separate application processes. Admission to the university does not ensure admission to the program. Application to the nutrition program requires submission of the online application form and submission of college transcripts if transferring from another college or university. Please refer to the programs webpage for theonline application form and instructions.A total college GPA of 2.8or better on a 4.0 scale includingall transferable creditis required for admissions.Retention-Progression Policy:Nutrition students will be allowed to progress in the nutrition program as all nutrition courses are completed with a C or higher and all sciences courses are completed with a passing grade. Progression status will be evaluated at the close of each semester; students receiving less than a C in any of the classes listed above will be placed on probation. A student on probation who receives a second grade of less than C in one of the courses listed above will not be permitted to progress in the nutrition curriculum. Students earning failing grades in any nutrition or science course will be reviewed by faculty to determine feasibility of progression. Following the faculty review of student performance, an individual plan for curriculum completion will be presented for consideration for any student affected.Accredited by ACEND: Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics, 120 S.

The program provides a basic knowledge of the social welfare system, the social work profession, and the professional knowledge, values, and skills necessary for entry-level professional social work practice as a generalist. The program also prepares students to pursue graduate study in social work and related professions.The program builds upon a liberal arts base and encompasses an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing from such fields as psychology, sociology, political science, and human biology.The programs overall mission is to prepare students with the competencies that reflect the core values and ethical obligations necessary for generalist practice in the social work profession. The mission of ETSUs BSW program is consistent with ETSUs mission and supports the philosophy and purpose of social work in promoting human dignity and community well-being through the promotion of social and economic justice, the prevention of conditions that limit human rights, the elimination of poverty, and the enhancement of the quality of life for all persons. The total program functions to provide leadership and instruction that will ensure preparation of a continuous pool of social work graduates who are able to assume professional positions in a variety of social welfare settings, especially in Northeastern Tennessee and the southern Appalachian region.The faculty believes that the philosophy of social work must be demonstrated as it is taught and, as such, must be incorporated into not only faculty-student relationships but also relationships between the program and the social work practice community.
