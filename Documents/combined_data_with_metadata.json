This concentration is designed for students who wish to pursue careers in computer security and in networking-enabled application development. This concentration is also recommended for those who plan to do graduate work in cybersecurity.Grade Requirement PolicyFor satisfactory progression in the major or minor, the student must attain:An overall GPA of 2.5 or better; andA GPA of 2.5 or better in all computing courses; andA grade of B- or better inCSCI 1250andCSCI 1260.A grade of \u201cC-\u201d or better in all other major requirements. This includes both common core and concentration-specific courses and all courses from other departments that satisfy major requirements.A minimum grade of \u201cC\u201d inENGL 1010andENGL 1020.All computing majors or minors may attempt CSCI courses a maximum of three times. An attempt is defined as registering for and remaining in a class until the last day to drop the course without a \u2018W grade as specified in the Academic Calendar. (Earning a grade in the class, including W or WF, counts as an attempt.)If a student, following a third attempt to take a given course, fails to earn a grade that meets the Departments standard for minimal performance in that course as specified in the Catalog, the student will be barred from further opportunity to enroll in that class. If this class is integral to that students current program of study, the student will be required to change his/her program of study. Depending on the course, this may disqualify the student from continuing in a minor; in one or more concentrations; or in the major.A student may file an appeal with the Chair of the Department of Computing requesting a fourth attempt to take a course.Such an appeal can only be made once by a student concerning any and all CSCI courses.All concentrations must complete 124 credits, including the ETSU General Education Requirements, the common computing core, and the concentration-specific courses.CISC majors must pass the proficiency exam or completeCSCI 1100 - Using Information Technologyprior to accumulating 30 credits.Graduation PolicyGraduation Requirement:Students must successfully completethe Computing Senior Exam (CSE) before graduation.

One class per year is admitted in the fall. Students are required to attend designated consecutive semesters to complete the program. Successful completion of the program enables students to take the National Board Exam for Dental Hygiene and clinical board exams as required for licensure leading to the credentials of Registered Dental Hygienist. The dental hygienist works with the dental team in the prevention and control of dental disease and has the opportunity to work in diverse settings. In addition to the private dental office, dental hygienists may work in such practice settings as: federal, state, and local health departments, hospitals, nursing homes, school systems, educational programs for dental hygiene and dental assisting students, private business/industry, correctional facilities, private and public centers for pediatric, geriatric, and other individuals/groups with special needs, and health maintenance organizations. The dental hygienist, a recognized member of the dental team, is devoted to helping patients prevent dental disease and maintain good oral health. The responsibilities of a licensed dental hygienist in Tennessee include scaling and polishing teeth, applying topical fluoride agents, placing pit and fissure sealants, providing nutritional counseling, exposing and processing dental radiographs, and educating the patient in the proper care of their teeth and supporting structures.Admission- Students must be admitted both to the university and to the program, requiring separate application processes. Admission to the university does not ensure admission to the program. Application to the dental hygiene program requires submission of the onlineapplication formand submission of all college transcripts to the program. Completed application materials must be received by March 1.The dental hygiene program at East Tennessee State University is participating in the American Dental Education Association Dental Hygiene Centralized Application Service (ADEA DHCAS).Applicants applying to the entry level Bachelor of Science program will apply online using the ADEA DHCAS application. To learn more about ADEA DHCAS, please visitwww.adea.org/dhcas.Expenses: In addition to the usual registration and tuition, students are required to purchase such personal items as uniforms, dental instruments, specialized textbooks, laboratory materials, and specialized equipment. Expenditures for these items, which are the personal property of the student, are approximately $5,000. Most of this additional expense occurs during the first year of study.Retention - Progression Policy:Dental Hygiene students will be allowed to progress in the dental hygiene curriculum as all dental hygiene courses and basic science courses (Anatomy and Physiology, Microbiology, and Chemistry) are completed with a grade of C- or better. Progression status will be evaluated at the close of each semester. Students receiving less than a C- in any of the classes listed above will be placed on probation. A student on probation who receives a second grade of less than C- in one of the classes listed above will not be permitted to progress in the dental hygiene curriculum. Students earning a failing gradein any dental hygiene course will be reviewed by the faculty to determine feasibility of progression.
