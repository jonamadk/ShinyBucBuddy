To that end, the program will prepare students for roles as audiologists and clinic directors by providing advanced practical experiences in a variety of settings and by directing students to appropriate clinical training sites. The program is intended to prepare students as audiologists able to uphold the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)Code of Ethics and provide the standard of care in a variety of diagnostic and rehabilitative areas. Although the Au.D. is a clinical doctorate, it will provide students with the analytical and substantive knowledge needed to assess and improve the effectiveness of practice, and the utilization of research. Two tracks are available for admission into and matriculation through the Au.D. program. Students who apply to the program while holding the bachelors degree take the Traditional Entry track. Students who apply to the program while holding a masters degree in Audiology may take the Advanced Standing track.Program Admission RequirementsApplicants seeking admission to the Au.D. degree program must fulfill all the requirements for admission to both the School of Graduate Studies and the Department of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology. The School of Graduate Studies requires that all students submit the following materials: a completed application form including payment of a nonrefundable application fee; transcripts of all previous undergraduate and graduate work; and a written essay.Traditional Entry TrackIn addition to requirements of the Graduate School, the Department of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology requirements for admission to the Traditional Entry Track include:Cumulative GPA of 3.25 (on a 4.0 scale) for the last two years of undergraduate study.At least eight credits in the lab sciences (chemistry, biology, or physics).At least six credits in college-level mathematics of which at least 3 credits must be in the study of statistics.At least 6 credits in the behavioral and/or social sciences such as normal, abnormal, developmental, and/or experimental psychology, sociology, or anthropology.Completion of an interview.Three letters of recommendation.Curriculum Vitae (CV).Advanced Standing TrackIn addition to requirements of the School of Graduate Studies, the Department of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology requirements for admission to the Advanced Standing Track include:Cumulative GPA of 3.25 (on a 4.0 scale) in graduate-level audiology courses. Students will be required to repeat a course in any audiology foundation area in which they received a \u201cC\u201d as a graduate or undergraduate.Completion of an interview.Three letters of recommendation from peers and/or employers that address the clinical activities performed by the applicant.Successful completion of a masters degree in Communication Sciences and Disorders in a program accredited by ASHA and the Council on Academic Accreditation in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (CAA).Applicants must provide evidence of audiology-related employment and continuing education since matriculation, including statements pertaining to scope of practice, areas of expertise, and perceived areas of weakness.Applicants must meet the certification standards as specified by ASHA and must be current holders of the CCC-A.Applications to the Advanced Standing Track will be screened for the following criteria:Quality of scholarship at the graduate level.Quality of coursework completed at the graduate level.Amount and variety of clinical experience since acquiring the M.S. degree.Professional activity other than clinical work (i.e., publications, research assistantships, affiliations with state and national organizations, professional activities, and presentations).Applications cannot be evaluated until they are completed. The evaluation process considers elements from the admission requirements, relevant professional experience, and the applicants ability, during the required interview, to discuss goals and expectations related to doctoral study of audiology. Interview times will be scheduled by the Department of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology. All admission requirements related to clinical practicum and progression standards are consistent with those of the department.RequirementsStudents in the Au.D. program must complete a minimum of 120 credit hours (75 credits of coursework, 45 credits of clinic practicum) and meet the academic and practicum requirements for the Certificate of Clinical Competence of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.Coursework Requirements- Each Au.D. candidate must complete the required 75-credit-hour program of study. Any elective coursework completed by a student will be in addition to the 75-hour minimum. The fourth year of study consists of a clinic externship. Competency across the scope of didactic courses and clinical practice will be assessed throughout the program of study. Consistent with ASHA knowledge and skills acquisition requirements, students will display competence in all areas of audiologic practice prior to graduation.Clinical Requirement- In addition to the departments requirements for enrollment in and progression through clinical practicum, each degree candidate must complete a minimum of 45 credit-hours of clinic practicum including a fourth-year, full-time externship.Beginning January 1, 2020, The Council for Clinical Certification in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology (CFCC) will no longer prescribe a specific number of hours of supervised clinical practicum. Consequently, the Au.D. program provides necessary experiences needed to meet CAA standards for duration, and for depth and breadth of knowledge.The departments guidelines regarding progression through the clinic pertain to the Au.D. degree with the exception of the sequence of clinical competency levels. Au.D. students and supervisors document clinical competence goals and track student progression as goals are exceeded, met, or not met. No levels of progression are completed; rather levels of competence are assessed across the clinical activities that comprise audiological practice.Comprehensive and Qualifying Examinations- Written comprehensive examinations are required prior to completion ofthe first year of coursework to facilitate formative assessment of the student. Results may indicate the need to review or modify a students program of study. A set of written qualifying examinations is required prior to completion ofthe second year of study in which the student should demonstrate the breadth of knowledge (provided by the foundation courses) required for continued doctoral study in audiology. Students who fail any portion of the comprehensive orqualifying examination will complete an oral examination addressing that material related to the failing grade. Students who fail any portion of the oral examination will retake the relevant coursework,modify their programs of study appropriately, or may be dismissed from the program. At the end of the third year of coursework, students will complete an oral comprehensive examination designed to assess integration of course material and decision-making skills specifically related to clinical practice. The student cannot progress to the fourth-year externship without first passing the qualifying examination and the oral comprehensive examination sequence.Research Project- A Capstone Research project is optional, but not required, for students in the AuD Program who are interested in research. The Capstone project must be mutually agreed upon by the student and a faculty mentor by the beginning of the 2ndyear in the program.Time Limit- The time limit for completion of the Au.D. degree program by a student issix years from the date of enrollment in the earliest course applied toward the degree.

The defense is a capstone event in the development of graduate students as scholars, professionals, or future teachers and must entail open and fair exchange of scholarly views. A member of the graduate faculty from outside the candidates committee and department must be present at the defense to monitor the process. The procedure to be followed in scheduling an oral defense and the format for the graduate faculty representatives narrative report are available on the Graduate School website. Dissertation - All doctoral candidates must complete a dissertation as a major requirement for the Ph.D. degree. The dissertation topic will be selected by the candidate with the advice and approval of the graduate advisory committee. The student must present a prospectus describing the research project for review and approval by the graduate advisory committee. After the dissertation topic has been researched, written, and accepted by the committee, it must be prepared in the proper format and submitted to the Graduate School by the initial submission deadline listed in the Academic Calendar. The Graduate School receives the submission electronically.Please follow the guidelines and checklist of requirements listed on the Electronic Thesis and Dissertations (ETD) website for further instructions. Institutional Review Board - Student research involving human subjects must be approved by the East Tennessee State University Institutional Review Board prior to initiation of the research. This is necessary to protect the rights of human subjects involved in physical, psychological, or social research. Following approval of the proposed research by the review board, the subject involved must be informed of the study and consent to participate. The application forms for research involving human subjects and review of such research projects are available in the Of\ufb01ce of Research and Sponsored Programs, 1110 Seminole Drive. Evaluation - The evaluation of an advanced graduate student is a function of the instructors and the students graduate advisory committee.

Each student will select a research advisor following completion of the first year in the program. The research advisor will assume primary responsibility for the students academic and research progress. Prior to theend of the first semester of the second year of study, students will form a graduate advisory committee. The advisory committee will be comprised of three faculty members from the students primary research concentration, one faculty member from outside the students/advisors primary concentration and one faculty member outside the students/advisors department.This faculty member may or may not be in the same primary research concentration. There would be a minimum of five faculty members on the committee (with the faculty advisor as chair of the committee). The students research advisor will serve as chair of the committee and must hold full or associate graduate faculty status. Other members of the committee will be selected by the student and research advisor and will be approved by the departmental chair and Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Education. The committee will be responsible for overseeing the students overall academic program, including the program of study, preliminary examination, advancement to candidacy and preparation and defense of the dissertation. The advisory committee should meet formally with the student at least once each year to review the research and academic progress. The Preliminary Examination - A preliminary examination may be administered at the discretion of the advisory committee after one semester of enrollment. The examination will be designed to evaluate the students potential to complete a total planned program and to aid in planning the program of study. Change in Program of Study - Changes in the planned program of study for candidacy must be approved by the Dean of the College of Graduate and Continuing Studies. Forms for program changes are available on the Graduate School website. Residence Requirements - A period of one academic year (two continuous semesters) will be required in keeping with the needs of the program and with accreditation standards. A student may be assigned to study at an off-campus site for special programs. This study must be approved in advance by the students graduate advisory committee to be applied toward residency requirements. No more than nine credit-hours of credit may be earned in special programs. Time Limits - Credit received more than seven years prior to the awarding of the degree will not be accepted as part of the degree requirements. Qualifying Examination - The qualifying examination will be administered by the advisory committee.The qualifying exam should be completed no later than three months after completion of the core curriculum.If the qualifying exam is not attempted or passed by this deadline, a period of remediation will be extended until the end of the third year. Students must petition the Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Education for exemptions or extensions of this deadline.Successful completion of the examination should demonstrate that the student has obtained a breadth of knowledge in biomedical science, utilizing the information obtained in the core curriculum. The student should also demonstrate competence in researching the literature and organizing and presenting information on a topic of current importance. The format of the written examination will be a research proposal similar in style to a research grant application. The topic can be selected either by the student and approved in advance by the advisory committee or selected by the advisory committee. An oral examination, in which the student defendsthe written research, follows successful completion of the written requirement.Please see the Biomedical Science Graduate Program Student Handbook for additional details regarding the qualifying exam. The Final Examination - The \ufb01nal examination will be oral and will be devoted to an evaluation and defense of the students dissertation. A student must be a formally admitted candidate for the doctorate for one full semester before being eligible to take the \ufb01nal examination. Students will not be allowed to complete a program during the same semester in which they are formally admitted to doctoral candidacy. The examination for defense of the dissertation will not be scheduled until the students dissertation is accepted by the graduate advisory committee. However, this approval and the \ufb01nal oral examination must both take place by the deadline in the university calendar. Each doctoral students \ufb01nal oral examination will be publicly announced.It will be an open examination, and all interested persons will be encouraged to attend. Graduate Faculty Representation at Dissertation Defenses - The defense of the dissertation is a formal gathering at which the doctoral candidate presents and defends her or his research to members of the university community. The defense is a capstone event in the development of graduate students as scholars, professionals, or future teachers and must entail open and fair exchange of scholarly views. A member of the graduate faculty from outside the candidates committee and department must be present at the defense to monitor the process. The procedure to be followed in scheduling an oral defense and the format for the graduate faculty representatives narrative report are available on the Graduate School website. Dissertation - All doctoral candidates must complete a dissertation as a major requirement for the Ph.D. degree. The dissertation topic will be selected by the candidate with the advice and approval of the graduate advisory committee. The student must present a prospectus describing the research project for review and approval by the graduate advisory committee. After the dissertation topic has been researched, written, and accepted by the committee, it must be prepared in the proper format and submitted to the Graduate School by the initial submission deadline listed in the Academic Calendar. The Graduate School receives the submission electronically.Please follow the guidelines and checklist of requirements listed on the Electronic Thesis and Dissertations (ETD) website for further instructions. Institutional Review Board - Student research involving human subjects must be approved by the East Tennessee State University Institutional Review Board prior to initiation of the research. This is necessary to protect the rights of human subjects involved in physical, psychological, or social research. Following approval of the proposed research by the review board, the subject involved must be informed of the study and consent to participate. The application forms for research involving human subjects and review of such research projects are available in the Of\ufb01ce of Research and Sponsored Programs, 1110 Seminole Drive. Evaluation - The evaluation of an advanced graduate student is a function of the instructors and the students graduate advisory committee. The latter has full authority for program planning and the evaluation of oral and written preliminary and qualifying examinations, provided that all university and departmental requirements have been met.

The College of Nursing currently offers four concentrations within the degree: Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner, Nursing and Healthcare Leadership, Family Nurse Practitioner, and Psychiatric/Mental Health Nurse Practitioner.The Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitionerprepares nurses to provide advanced nursing care to populations from ages 13 and older. The DNP degree provides graduates the abilities needed to assume practice and leadership positions in the healthcare team, to evaluate patient population and systems aimed to improve health outcomes. Patient, family, and community-centered care includes providing care for common and acute illnesses, managing chronic conditions, and managing care transitions across systems while emphasizing quality care and health outcomes.Graduates will be eligible for the Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner National Certification examination. Graduates are prepared to practice in various healthcare settings.For application terms and deadlines please refer to the College of Nursing website.Degree RequirementsBSN to DNPFNP concentration:83 credits/1000 clock hoursANP/GNP concentration:85 credits/1000 clock hoursPMHNP concentration:80 credits/1000 clock hoursExecutive Leadership concentration:77 credits/1000 clock hoursMSN to DNPAll concentrations:32 credits/500 clock hoursSpecific courses are required of students who plan to take a national certification examination. All students are required to complete a Capstone Project.PhD to DNP Degree or DNP to PhD DegreeA student holding an earned doctoral degree from a regionally accredited U.S. institution may qualify for a second doctoral degree and may have a program of study that is up to 15 credit hours shorter depending on coursework taken in the prior doctoral program and approved by the students ETSU advisory committee and DNP or PhD Coordinator. All specific program requirements, with the possible exception of elective courses or duplicative courses, must be met for the second degree. Degree requirements that must be met include the candidacy examination and dissertation for the PhD,or theCapstone project for the DNP. In warranted circumstances credit used to satisfy approved ETSU graduate certificate requirements may be applied toward the second doctoral degree.Please consult the PhD and DNP curricula and concentrations for specific program requirements and sample programs of study.Progression StandardsStudents in graduate nursing programs must meet the requirements of the School of Graduate Studies to remain in good standing. An overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 (B) or better must be maintained.In addition, a nursing student must achieve a \u201cB\u201d or better in every graduate nursing course. Policies of the School of Graduate Studies for progression will apply.DNP students who receive less than a \u201cB\u201d in a course will have one opportunity to repeat the course.If a students cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0, she/he will be placed on academic probation the following semester. If the student does not achieve a 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the conclusion of one probationary semester, the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies and the Associate Dean for Academic Programs in the College of Nursing will determine if the student should be dismissed from graduate study or continued on academic probation. No student will be allowed more than two probationary semesters, whether consecutive or cumulative. At the end of a second probationary semester, a student whose cumulative grade point average is still below 3.0 will be dismissed from graduate study.Students whose performance results in a GPA so far below 3.0 as to make it mathematically impossible to attain an overall GPA of 3.0 after one semester may be subject to dismissal without a probationary term.An incomplete grade (\u201cI\u201d) indicates that the student was passing the course at the end of the semester, but due to circumstances beyond the students control, was unable to complete the course work for which the \u201cI\u201d is assigned. The \u201cI\u201d grade cannot be used to allow a student to do additional work to raise a deficient grade or to repeat a course. An \u201cI\u201d grade must be removed no later than one calendar year from the time the grade is awarded. Students with more than one \u201cI\u201d grade cannot progress in the program. Time extension requests for removal of an \u201cI\u201d grade must be submitted to and approved by the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies before the allotted time expires. An \u201cI\u201d grade not removed under the guidelines in the Graduate Catalog will be converted to an \u201cF.\u201dDNP students may have grades of \u201cWF\u201d in no more than one semester within an academic year.Students who wish to change from part-time to full-time status must submit a written request to the College of Nursings Office of Student Services. Request will be approved on an individual basis, taking into consideration the students academic performance and available clinical slots.Students must maintain an unencumbered registered nurse license in all states where they are currently licensed throughout the duration of the graduate program and in the state(s) where they fulfill clinical course requirements. If at any time during enrollment in the graduate program a students nursing license becomes encumbered, suspended, or revoked, the student must immediately report this to the Associate DeanGraduate Programs in the College of Nursing.

An overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 (B) or better must be maintained.In addition, a nursing student must achieve a \u201cB\u201d or better in every graduate nursing course. Policies of the School of Graduate Studies for progression will apply.DNP students who receive less than a \u201cB\u201d in a course will have one opportunity to repeat the course.If a students cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0, she/he will be placed on academic probation the following semester. If the student does not achieve a 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the conclusion of one probationary semester, the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies and the Associate Dean for Academic Programs in the College of Nursing will determine if the student should be dismissed from graduate study or continued on academic probation. No student will be allowed more than two probationary semesters, whether consecutive or cumulative.

The \u201cI\u201d grade cannot be used to allow a student to do additional work to raise a deficient grade or to repeat a course. An \u201cI\u201d grade must be removed no later than one calendar year from the time the grade is awarded. Students with more than one \u201cI\u201d grade cannot progress in the program. Time extension requests for removal of an \u201cI\u201d grade must be submitted to and approved by the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies before the allotted time expires. An \u201cI\u201d grade not removed under the guidelines in the Graduate Catalog will be converted to an \u201cF.\u201dDNP students may have grades of \u201cWF\u201d in no more than one semester within an academic year.Students who wish to change from part-time to full-time status must submit a written request to the College of Nursings Office of Student Services. Request will be approved on an individual basis, taking into consideration the students academic performance and available clinical slots.Students must maintain an unencumbered registered nurse license in all states where they are currently licensed throughout the duration of the graduate program and in the state(s) where they fulfill clinical course requirements. If at any time during enrollment in the graduate program a students nursing license becomes encumbered, suspended, or revoked, the student must immediately report this to the Associate DeanGraduate Programs in the College of Nursing. If a students registered nurse license is suspended or revoked, or a student fails to report any changes in licensure status to the Associate DeanGraduate Programs, the student will be administratively withdrawn from the graduate program. A students ability to continue enrollment in the graduate program with an encumbered license will be reviewed on an individual basis considering the restriction/limitations placed on the students practice as a registered nurse by the board of nursing in the state issuing the encumbered license.Grade Scale: A=93-100; B=84-92; C=75-83; F=less than 75.The student is referred to the Graduate Catalog for more detailed progression information.Nursing D.N.P.The Doctor of Nursing Practice (D.N.P.) is designed to produce leaders in nursing and health care practice.

No student will be allowed more than two probationary semesters, whether consecutive or cumulative. At the end of a second probationary semester, a student whose cumulative grade point average is still below 3.0 will be dismissed from graduate study.Students whose performance results in a GPA so far below 3.0 as to make it mathematically impossible to attain an overall GPA of 3.0 after one semester may be subject to dismissal without a probationary term.An incomplete grade (\u201cI\u201d) indicates that the student was passing the course at the end of the semester, but due to circumstances beyond the students control, was unable to complete the course work for which the \u201cI\u201d is assigned. The \u201cI\u201d grade cannot be used to allow a student to do additional work to raise a deficient grade or to repeat a course. An \u201cI\u201d grade must be removed no later than one calendar year from the time the grade is awarded. Students with more than one \u201cI\u201d grade cannot progress in the program.

If at any time during enrollment in the graduate program a students nursing license becomes encumbered, suspended, or revoked, the student must immediately report this to the Associate DeanGraduate Programs in the College of Nursing. If a students registered nurse license is suspended or revoked, or a student fails to report any changes in licensure status to the Associate DeanGraduate Programs, the student will be administratively withdrawn from the graduate program.

If the student does not achieve a 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the conclusion of one probationary semester, the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies and the associated Program Directorin the College of Nursing will determine if the student should be dismissed from graduate study or continued on academic probation. No student will be allowed more than two probationary semesters, whether consecutive or cumulative. At the end of a second probationary semester, a student whose cumulative grade point average is still below 3.0 will be dismissed from graduate study.Students whose performance results in a GPA so far below 3.0 as to make it mathematically impossible to attain an overall GPA of 3.0 after one semester may be subject to dismissal without a probationary term.Policies of the School of Graduate Studies for progression will apply.Students who wish to change from part-time to full-time status must submit a written request to the College of Nursings Office of Student Services. Requests will be approved on an individual basis, taking into consideration the students academic performance and available clinical slots.Criminal Background ChecksTo progress clinically, students will be required to complete a Criminal Background Check at his or her own expense from a specified vendor. Unfavorable results may result in a students inability to continue in clinical courses; review of the contents of the background check and the determination for eligibility for participation at a clinical site will be conducted by affiliated clinical agencies. Although the College of Nursing does not receive the contents of the background check, documentation of completion is kept with the students Clinical Course Health Requirement file.General InformationAdvisementUpon admission to the doctoral program, the student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will work with the student in developing the initial program of study and advising the student throughout their program of study and residencies.Requirements for Completion of the DegreeStudents must comply with all policies of the ETSU School of Graduate Studies regarding retention, progression, and graduation as described in the Graduate Catalog. If dismissed, a student has the option to apply for reinstatement. Students must become licensed or authorized to practice professional nursing in Tennessee or a compact state, demonstrate evidence of professional malpractice insurance in the amount of $1,000,000/$3,000,000 coverage, have current CPR certification and a knowledge of universal precautions, have completed a criminal background check per the College of Nursing policy, and comply with the clinical requirements of the College of Nursing. A student may be asked to present evidence of physical or mental health at any time during the nursing program, and continuance in the program may be contingent upon this evidence.Residency Requirements- The purpose of the residency requirement is to build a community of scholars. It provides doctoral students with significant time for sustained participation with peers and faculty members in scholarly and creative activities. A student in the PhDprogram will fulfill the residency requirement by accomplishing selected professional activities such as scholarly writing, research, presentations, consulting, and grant writing, as specified in a residency plan. (Guidelines for Residency Activities will be provided.) The residency plan must be approved by the students advisor and the PhDDirectorin the College of Nursing. Each student must complete the required approved residency activities and submit a residency portfolio as documentation no later than thirty days prior to the candidacy examination.Candidacy Examination- The purpose of the candidacy examination is to ensure that students are able to think analytically, have a comprehensive knowledge of the field and specialty, and be deemed capable of completing the dissertation. The examination tests the nursing core courses in philosophy of science, theory, quantitative and qualitative research, statistics, health policy leadership, bioethics, and a cognate.All students must be registered for a minimum of one (1) semester hour of coursework in the semester in which they take or re-take the candidacy examination; upon completion of all coursework the student should register for one (1) credit hour ofNRSE 6960 - Doctoral Dissertation. The outcome of the Candidacy Examination process can be \u201cPass\u201d which means the student has successfully completed all steps of the process or \u201cFail\u201d, which means the student begins the candidacy process again. Students whose second written submission is unacceptable will be dismissed from the program. Guidelines for the Candidacy Examination will be provided.Dissertation- Each doctoral candidate must complete a dissertation as a major requirement for the Ph.D. degree.A dissertation proposal consisting of the first three (3) chapters of the dissertation will be completed and presented for approval to the students advisory committee prior to seeking IRB approval, and initiation of the research project.Instead of producing a traditional dissertation, students may author three publishable manuscripts to fulfill the dissertation requirements. One of the three manuscripts must be published prior to approval of the dissertation. Students must comply with applicable University and College guidelines during the dissertation process. Choosing this option will be a joint decision made by the doctoral student and the dissertation chair. The decision to choose the manuscript dissertation option may occur at any time during the students program of study. The manuscripts may be produced during upon completion of any doctoral course or during the candidacy period.Once the dissertation research has been conducted, the results analyzed, and the report written and accepted by the advisory committee, an oral defense of the dissertation will be scheduled. The dissertation must be prepared in accordance with School of Graduate Studies guidelines and submitted to the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies for approval. General guidelines on the dissertation format and procedures to be followed in scheduling an oral defense are available in the School of Graduate Studies.Time Limit- The time limit for completion of the PhDdegree program by a student is seven (7) years from the date of enrollment in the earliest course applied toward the degree.Program of Study- The PhD curriculum is composed of a minimum of 60credit hours, including courses in foundations of scientific inquiry, research methods and data analysis, and nursing science; cognate courses, to complement the students previous experiences, career goals, and dissertation focus; and dissertation hours.A minimum of nine (9)credits is required for the cognate courses.Opportunities for role development are provided within the nursing and cognate courses and through professional activities as specified within the students residency plans. Students in the PhDprogram may select courses only at the 5000, 6000, or 7000 levels; at least one-half of all courses within the doctoral students program of study must be at the 6000/7000 levels.

Though diverse in respect to methods of inquiry and areas of study, the faculty is of one mind in promoting scientific inquiry as the foundation of clinical psychology. The programs philosophy also emphasizes the respect for and understanding of cultural and individual diversity in policies for recruitment, retention, the development of faculty and students, and in the curriculum and filed placements. The program has nondiscriminatory policies and operating procedures, and it avoids any actions that would restrict program access or completion on grounds that are irrelevant to success in graduate training or the profession.The primary mission of the articulated masters/doctoral program in theClinical ConcentrationinPsychology at ETSU is to provide training in clinical psychology emphasizing rural behavioral health and practice in the context of integrated primary health care. ETSU has a uniquely cooperative relationship with its surrounding community and region. Because of this relationship the program is unique in what it can offer students in the field of health services psychology.All students receive a curriculum of general clinical training as well as training in the basic science of psychology. Thus, the first two years of the program are highly structured. Due to the emphasis in primary care and rural health practice as well as adherence to the generalist model of training, the advanced coursework is more structured than some programs in clinical psychology, but students are afforded the opportunity for individualization through electives, research emphasis, and externship placements.The program is designed for full-time study only as a 5-year post-baccalaureate articulated M.A./Ph.D. program, with the fifth year being an off-campus full-time internship that is in keeping with APA/APPIC requirements.Students seeking a terminal masters degree will not be considered for admission. The clinical concentration is accredited by the American Psychological Association.Admission RequirementsTo be accepted into theM.A./Ph.D. in psychologyclinical concentration students must apply for, and engage in, full-time study. Applicants to the MA/PhD degree program are evaluated only once each year, for admission in the fall semester; applicants are not considered for spring admission. Complete applications must be submitted to the ETSU Graduate Schoolby December 1st for admission to the following fall semester (https://www.etsu.edu/gradschool/applynow.php).Students holding a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited institution will be considered for the M.A./Ph.D. program. Students admitted to the Clinical Concentration inPsychology Ph.D. program complete the requirements for an M.A. in Psychology, Clinical Psychology Concentration (47 hour program of study with thesis) as part of their Ph.D. requirements.Students already holding the M.A. or M.S. in psychology from a regionally accredited institution may also apply to the M.A./Ph.D. program. The masters degree must be commensurate with the M.A. program inPsychology at ETSU and involve the successful completion of an empirically based thesis project.
