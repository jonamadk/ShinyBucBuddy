This interdisciplinary graduate certificate represents a partnership between several academic departments and units, including Appalachian Studies, Biological Sciences, Communication Studies, Geosciences, History, Liberal Studies, and Sociology and Anthropology. The Heritage Interpretation and Museum Studies Graduate Certificate is a 21-credit interdisciplinary program for students who would like to increase their knowledge of museum studies and heritage interpretation. The certificate prepares students to pursue a career in a museum, heritage site, or similar organization. The certificate may also prepare students to pursue additional graduate studies in heritage interpretation, museum studies, public history, or related fields. The certificate is also quite helpful to those who are already working in the field and wish to enhance their professional skills or credentials. Northeast Tennessee is home to a large number of museums and heritage sites, and cultural heritage tourism is one of the most important and fastest-growing segments of the regions economy. This certificate provides knowledge and skills for students interested in this field. This program is distinguished from similar programs in that it strongly emphasizes the communication and storytelling skills that are essential to the creative interpretation of natural and cultural resources. Heritage interpretation is the way in which natural, cultural, or historic resources are presented to the public, helping them to experience the resources, discover meaning, and form connections. The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) defines heritage as \u201cthe legacy that we receive from the past, that we experience in the present, and that we will pass on to future generations.\u201d Heritage encompasses both natural heritage (features of the natural landscape) and cultural heritage (the whole range of cultural resources created or built by humans in the past). How a community interprets and uses its heritage plays an important role in sustainable developmentby helping to build a sense of community among diverse groups and individuals,creating jobs and economic growth through heritage tourism,building respect for history and for cultural and social diversity,and challenging prejudice and stereotypes. This graduate certificate can be an excellent complement to masters degrees or graduate certificates in several disciplines, including anthropology,Appalachian studies,archival studies, biological sciences, communication and storytelling studies,geosciences,history,public administration,sociology,and storytelling. Admission Requirements In addition to the admissions criteria set by the ETSU School of Graduate Studies, the following are required: Three letters of recommendation from academic or professional mentors or associates.

An overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 (B) or better must be maintained. In addition, a nursing student must achieve a \u201cB\u201d or better in every graduate nursing course.

Students whose performance results in a GPA so far below 3.0 as to make it mathematically impossible to attain an overall GPA of 3.0 after one semester may be subject to dismissal without a probationary term. An incomplete grade (\u201cI\u201d) indicates that the student was passing the course at the end of the semester, but due to circumstances beyond the students control, was unable to complete the course work for which the \u201cI\u201d is assigned. The \u201cI\u201d grade cannot be used to allow a student to do additional work to raise a deficient grade or to repeat a course. An \u201cI\u201d grade must be removed no later than one calendar year from the time the grade is awarded. Students with more than one \u201cI\u201d grade cannot progress in the program. Time extension requests for removal of an \u201cI\u201d grade must be submitted to and approved by the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies before the allotted time expires. An \u201cI\u201d grade not removed under the guidelines in the Graduate Catalog will be converted to an \u201cF.\u201d Students may have grades of \u201cWF\u201d in no more than one semester within an academic year. Students must maintain an unencumbered registered nurse license in all states where they are currently licensed throughout the duration of the graduate program and in the state(s) where they fulfill clinical course requirements. If at any time during enrollment in the graduate program a students nursing license becomes encumbered, is suspended, or revoked, the student must immediately report this to the Associate DeanGraduate Programs in the College of Nursing. If a students registered nurse license is suspended or revoked, or if a student fails to report any changes in licensure status to the Associate Deanof Graduate Programs, the student will be administratively withdrawn from the graduate program.

Progression Policy Students in graduate nursing programs must meet the requirements of the School of Graduate Studies to remain in good standing. An overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 (B) or better must be maintained. In addition, a nursing student must achieve a \u201cB\u201d or better in every graduate nursing course. Policies of the School of Graduate Studies for progression will apply. Students who receive less than a \u201cB\u201d in a course will have one opportunity to repeat the course. If a students cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0, she/he will be placed on academic probation the following semester. If the student does not achieve a 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the conclusion of one probationary semester, the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies and the Associate DeanGraduate Programs in the College of Nursing will determine if the student should be dismissed from graduate study or continued on academic probation. No student will be allowed more than two probationary semesters, whether consecutive or cumulative. At the end of a second probationary semester, a student whose cumulative grade point average is still below 3.0 will be dismissed from graduate study. Students whose performance results in a GPA so far below 3.0 as to make it mathematically impossible to attain an overall GPA of 3.0 after one semester may be subject to dismissal without a probationary term. An incomplete grade (\u201cI\u201d) indicates that the student was passing the course at the end of the semester, but due to circumstances beyond the students control, was unable to complete the course work for which the \u201cI\u201d is assigned. The \u201cI\u201d grade cannot be used to allow a student to do additional work to raise a deficient grade or to repeat a course. An \u201cI\u201d grade must be removed no later than one calendar year from the time the grade is awarded. Students with more than one \u201cI\u201d grade cannot progress in the program. Time extension requests for removal of an \u201cI\u201d grade must be submitted to and approved by the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies before the allotted time expires. An \u201cI\u201d grade not removed under the guidelines in the Graduate Catalog will be converted to an \u201cF.\u201d Students may have grades of \u201cWF\u201d in no more than one semester within an academic year. Students must maintain an unencumbered registered nurse license in all states where they are currently licensed throughout the duration of the graduate program and in the state(s) where they fulfill clinical course requirements. If at any time during enrollment in the graduate program a students nursing license becomes encumbered, is suspended, or revoked, the student must immediately report this to the Associate DeanGraduate Programs in the College of Nursing. If a students registered nurse license is suspended or revoked, or if a student fails to report any changes in licensure status to the Associate Deanof Graduate Programs, the student will be administratively withdrawn from the graduate program. A students ability to continue enrollment in the graduate program with an encumbered license will be reviewed on an individual basis considering the restriction/limitations placed on the students practice as a registered nurse by the board of nursing in the state issuing the encumbered license. Grade Scale: A=93-100; B=84-92; C=75-83; F=less than 75.Grades maybe rounded at the discretion of the faculty. The student is referred to the Graduate Catalog for more detailed progression information.
