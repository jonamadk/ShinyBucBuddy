Our program seizes upon changes in workforce needs that have increasingly moved toward the integration of traditional professional communication with the creative, performance, and social advocacy-ready components associated with Storytelling.Through our communication focus, we examine how story, narrative, and discourse shape social meaning and facilitate social change, as well as how the study of story, narrative, and discourse can used to better understand diverse populations, to facilitate stronger connections and manage conflict within and across those populations, and to foster creative civil dialogue.We offer a two-year program with option for longer spans for part-time students. Students have opportunities to learn from practicing professionals and have the option to create a capstone project, write comprehensive exams, or write a thesis. Our faculty bring diverse talents, experiences, and credentials to our teaching environments to bridge theoretical and applied knowledge. As mentors, we work individually with every student to craft a program of study that helps each one meet their personal, professional, and intellectual goals.Graduate Admission CriteriaApplicants may begin the Communication & Storytelling, M.A. in fall or springsemesters, thougha fall semester entry is strongly recommended.Completed applications must be received in the Graduate School by March 1 for preferred consideration for admission in the next fall term and optimal funding consideration. Applicants are strongly encouraged to talk with the Graduate Coordinator prior to submitting application materials. Each applicant is evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:At least a 3.0 overall undergraduate grade point average.Three letters that recommend admission to graduate study and that sufficiently evidence the applicants potential for success in the Communication and Storytelling Studies program in particular.When selecting persons to write recommendation letters, please choose people who can address your academic/intellectual abilities in the discipline. Optimally, applicants should supply at least two letters from former or current professors, especially from those within the discipline, if possible. Letters from professionals should address the applicants applicable academic skills (e.g., research, writing, presentation and/or performance abilities), potential for intellectual growth, ability to work on multiple projects under pressure and autonomously, and overall work ethic.Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test scores predictive of success in the program.Applicants wishing to request waiver of the GRE requirement must contact the Graduate Coordinator and Graduate Program Specialist. Such students wouldparticipate in a formal telephone, or in-person interview with the Graduate Coordinator and faculty, and also submit an extended writing sample, 1500-2000 words in length, to the Graduate Coordinator. The writing sample is submitted separately from and is quite different from the application essay. The writing sample is to be an essay on the uses of storytelling and communication in a particular domain of contemporary professional or community practice (performance, education, health and well-being, law, ministry, social justice, business, non-profit organizations, community advocacy, peace promotion, etc.). This would involve some necessary background reading, research, and synthesizing thinking. Applicants may include first-person experience and reflection in support of their research. The language of myth and fantasy should be utilized only if the essay is an analysis of those subjects. In any case, the goal should be to employ language and thought appropriate to graduate-level study. Applicants must consult with the Graduate Coordinator prior to submitting the writing sample. Essays submitted without invitation from the Graduate Coordinator will not be accepted.The strength of an application essay that discussesboth interest and fit.The graduate school requires 150-300 words; the Communication and Storytelling Studies M.A. program strongly encourages applicants to write in the high end of that range. The application essay should explain why the applicant isinterestedin our particular graduate program. Additionally, the application essay should discuss why the applicant is a good fit for our program, thecourseswe require, andthe research or creative activityof our faculty. Applicants should consult the program website while crafting the application essay. If there are weaknesses in the applicants materials (e.g., low grades or GRE scores), these should be addressed in the essay as well.Applicants who are weak in one area may still be admitted if they have high credentials in other areas.CandidacyA student must apply for admission to candidacy after completion of the core semester hours in communication and storytelling studies. A program grade point average of 3.0 or higher and the removal of all conditions imposed at the time of admission to the School of Graduate Studies is required. At least 75 percent of the total course hours must be taken within the Department of Communication Studies and Storytelling.Articulation AgreementA student who completes the graduate certificate in Heritage Interpretation and Museum Studies and later wishes to pursue theMA inCommunication and Storytelling Studiesmay apply up to18certificate credits into the masters degree with the approval of the degree graduate coordinator and the School of Graduate Studies. Allcredit, however, must meet GPA requirements and must bewithin the six-year matriculation limits. Communication & Storytelling Studies, M.A."

Students may also choose one of three capstone options: a group software development project, an individual (independent) computing project, or a traditional thesis.Graduate Admission CriteriaIn addition to admission policies established by the Graduate School,all applicantsare required to submit the following:Undergraduate transcripts that show the equivalent of a major in a computing field with an overall GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Three letters of recommendationthat evaluate the applicants academic ability, professional maturity, and communication skills.A personal essaythat discusses the applicants reason for pursuing the M.S. in Computer Science.Acurriculum vita, detailing any IT-related work experience.In addition to the criteria above,international applicantsmustdemonstrateEnglish proficiencyas specified by Graduate SchoolAdmission Policies.Applicants will be evaluated for admission based on evidence of preparedness for graduate study in computer science, as attested to by academic performance and/or professional experience. Applicants without sufficient academic or professional experience may be admitted provisionally. Applicants lacking academic preparation may be required to complete (with a B- or higher in each course) undergraduate foundation courses in computer science and mathematics. Related professional experience, such as programming, systems analysis, and/or systems design, may be substituted for some foundation courses. Applicants who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted provisionally and must complete their first 9 credit hours in the program of study with a grade of B or higher in each course.Minimum M.S. Degree RequirementsDuring the period before candidacy, graduate students are advised by the departmental graduate coordinator or his designee. By the beginning of the second semester students should form their graduate advisory committee. The committees chair becomes the students primary advisor. The faculty member who directs the non-thesis students software development project serves as the students primary advisor and chair of the committee. Where choices exist, students will decide, in consultation with their advisor, which courses to take to complete the master of science degree.For students in a thesis option, the chair of the students graduate advisory committee directs the research and the preparation of the thesis. After selecting a topic, the student, in consultation with the students advisory committee chair, must develop a thesis proposal and plan which must be presented to the graduate faculty and approved by the students committee. The approval form must bear the signatures of the student and the advisory committee members. The student must orally present and defend the thesis.Advisory Committee- Students should have this committee formed at the beginning of the second semester in which coursework is taken. Students may not apply for candidacy for a graduate degree until the committee has been formed.Admission to Candidacy- To be admitted to candidacy a student must meet a number of requirements of the Graduate School (SeeDegree and Graduation Requirements).Courses Open to Graduate Students- Graduate-level courses are listed at the 5XXX level. Courses at the 4XX7-5XX7 level are subject to special rules concerning enrollment and applicability as electives. Students who desire graduate credit for a course that is offered at both levels must register at the 5XX7 level. Students who wish to count a 5XX7 course as an elective should check with the graduate coordinator about that courses standing before enrolling: courses that are not explicitly listed as possible electives are treated on a case-by-case basis, and some are not eligible to be counted as electives. A course taken for undergraduate-level credit (4XX7 level) cannot be repeated for graduate credit (5XX7 level). Graduate students who are registered for a 5XX7 level course are required to do additional work over and above that required for students registered at the 4XX7 level. At most, 30 percent of all credit-hours which are applicable to a masters program may be in courses at the 5XX7 level. Non-degree students who desire graduate credit may enroll for courses at the 5XXX level with consent of the instructor.Independent Study- No more than one independent study course (1-3 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate program coordinator.Special Topics- No more than two special topics courses (1-6 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate coordinator.Prerequisites for Graduate Study in Computer Science:Students must satisfy the program admission requirements (seeGraduate Admissions Criteriaabove). The foundation coursework includes the following:A background in mathematics including probability and statistics, discrete structures, and for the applied computer science concentration basic calculus.Computer programming, including problem analysis, algorithm, synthesis, and competence in data structures, with knowledge of a high level programming language and for the applied computer science concentration assembly language.Undergraduate-level coursework in database management systems. The applied computer science concentration requires additional work in file processing, computer architecture, and operating systems. The information technology track requires additional coursework in networking and web programming.Some graduate courses have additional or special prerequisites.AI and Machine Learning ConcentrationThe Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Concentration focuses on computational aspects of AI and ML algorithm design. Coursework surveys artificial intelligence while providing an in-depth look at machine learning and natural language processing from a programming and algorithmic perspective. Computer Science, M.S.

Students may also choose one of three capstone options: a group software development project, an individual (independent) computing project, or a traditional thesis.Graduate Admission CriteriaIn addition to admission policies established by the Graduate School,all applicantsare required to submit the following:Undergraduate transcripts that show the equivalent of a major in a computing field with an overall GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Three letters of recommendationthat evaluate the applicants academic ability, professional maturity, and communication skills.A personal essaythat discusses the applicants reason for pursuing the M.S. in Computer Science.Acurriculum vita, detailing any IT-related work experience.In addition to the criteria above,international applicantsmustdemonstrateEnglish proficiencyas specified by Graduate SchoolAdmission Policies.Applicants will be evaluated for admission based on evidence of preparedness for graduate study in computer science, as attested to by academic performance and/or professional experience. Applicants without sufficient academic or professional experience may be admitted provisionally. Applicants lacking academic preparation may be required to complete (with a B- or higher in each course) undergraduate foundation courses in computer science and mathematics. Related professional experience, such as programming, systems analysis, and/or systems design, may be substituted for some foundation courses. Applicants who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted provisionally and must complete their first 9 credit hours in the program of study with a grade of B or higher in each course.Minimum M.S. Degree RequirementsDuring the period before candidacy, graduate students are advised by the departmental graduate coordinator or his designee. By the beginning of the second semester students should form their graduate advisory committee. The committees chair becomes the students primary advisor. The faculty member who directs the non-thesis students software development project serves as the students primary advisor and chair of the committee. Where choices exist, students will decide, in consultation with their advisor, which courses to take to complete the master of science degree.For students in a thesis option, the chair of the students graduate advisory committee directs the research and the preparation of the thesis. After selecting a topic, the student, in consultation with the students advisory committee chair, must develop a thesis proposal and plan which must be presented to the graduate faculty and approved by the students committee. The approval form must bear the signatures of the student and the advisory committee members. The student must orally present and defend the thesis.Advisory Committee- Students should have this committee formed at the beginning of the second semester in which coursework is taken. Students may not apply for candidacy for a graduate degree until the committee has been formed.Admission to Candidacy- To be admitted to candidacy a student must meet a number of requirements of the Graduate School (SeeDegree and Graduation Requirements).Courses Open to Graduate Students- Graduate-level courses are listed at the 5XXX level. Courses at the 4XX7-5XX7 level are subject to special rules concerning enrollment and applicability as electives. Students who desire graduate credit for a course that is offered at both levels must register at the 5XX7 level. Students who wish to count a 5XX7 course as an elective should check with the graduate coordinator about that courses standing before enrolling: courses that are not explicitly listed as possible electives are treated on a case-by-case basis, and some are not eligible to be counted as electives. A course taken for undergraduate-level credit (4XX7 level) cannot be repeated for graduate credit (5XX7 level). Graduate students who are registered for a 5XX7 level course are required to do additional work over and above that required for students registered at the 4XX7 level. At most, 30 percent of all credit-hours which are applicable to a masters program may be in courses at the 5XX7 level. Non-degree students who desire graduate credit may enroll for courses at the 5XXX level with consent of the instructor.Independent Study- No more than one independent study course (1-3 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate program coordinator.Special Topics- No more than two special topics courses (1-6 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate coordinator.Prerequisites for Graduate Study in Computer Science:Students must satisfy the program admission requirements (seeGraduate Admissions Criteriaabove). The foundation coursework includes the following:A background in mathematics including probability and statistics, discrete structures, and for the applied computer science concentration basic calculus.Computer programming, including problem analysis, algorithm, synthesis, and competence in data structures, with knowledge of a high level programming language and for the applied computer science concentration assembly language.Undergraduate-level coursework in database management systems. The applied computer science concentration requires additional work in file processing, computer architecture, and operating systems. The information technology track requires additional coursework in networking and web programming.Some graduate courses have additional or special prerequisites.Applied Computer Science ConcentrationThe Applied Computer Science Concentration is oriented toward advanced computer science concepts and theory in a practical and applied manner. The program teaches advanced operating systems concepts through distributed systems while deepening the students understanding of networking.

Orthoses are technologies that serve as \u201cmotion control treatment\u201d for persons with dysfunction of the neuromuscular and skeletal systems of the limbs, spine and head due to stroke, cerebral palsy, scoliosis, arthritis, complex fracture, and other conditions. Prostheses are technologies that similarly serve as \u201cmotion control treatment\u201d to enable persons with limb loss, limb difference or limb absence due to trauma, body system dysfunction or congenital abnormality to function to the best of their abilities. The orthotist-prosthetist is a clinical practitioner/technology manager and member of the healthcare team that collaborates with physicians, therapists and the client. Additionally, the orthotist-prosthetist evaluates the unique needs, challenges and goals of the client. Then they apply their knowledge and skills to create the optimal combination of technologies that allow the client to achieve their goals. The process of providing care occurs in a variety of settings such as acute trauma hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ambulatory outpatient facilities, as well as research and education centers.The Orthotics and Prosthetics program offers the entry-level Master of Science in Orthotics and Prostheticsdegree. The degree is designed to integrate classroom, research, applied device design/fabrication and applied clinical learning experiences; to prepare its graduates to carry out effectively the expanding responsibilities of orthotists and prosthetists as health care providers practicing in environments ranging from clinical care to research and device design and development. Students who enter the program will have strong but diverse academic backgrounds reflecting their abilities to think creatively and independently, evaluate critically and systematically, and exercise good judgment. Additionally, students in the program should display the personal qualities of flexibility, responsibility, and sensitivity to others.Admission RequirementsThe Master of Science in Orthotics and Prostheticsprogram admits students by a selective admissions process to begin matriculation in the springsemester only.Students apply to the Master of Science in Orthotics and Prosthetics program through theOrthotics and Prosthetics Centralized Application Service (OPCAS).The program begins in the spring term (January).

        "document_content": "Orthotics and Prosthetics, is a unique and evolving healthcare profession that involves the design and creation of engineered wearable technologies to control movement (i.e., orthoses and prostheses) as part of the treatment plan for persons with physical challenges. Orthoses are technologies that serve as \u201cmotion control treatment\u201d for persons with dysfunction of the neuromuscular and skeletal systems of the limbs, spine and head due to stroke, cerebral palsy, scoliosis, arthritis, complex fracture, and other conditions. Prostheses are technologies that similarly serve as \u201cmotion control treatment\u201d to enable persons with limb loss, limb difference or limb absence due to trauma, body system dysfunction or congenital abnormality to function to the best of their abilities. The orthotist-prosthetist is a clinical practitioner/technology manager and member of the healthcare team that collaborates with physicians, therapists and the client. Additionally, the orthotist-prosthetist evaluates the unique needs, challenges and goals of the client. Then they apply their knowledge and skills to create the optimal combination of technologies that allow the client to achieve their goals. The process of providing care occurs in a variety of settings such as acute trauma hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, ambulatory outpatient facilities, as well as research and education centers.The Orthotics and Prosthetics program offers the entry-level Master of Science in Orthotics and Prostheticsdegree. The degree is designed to integrate classroom, research, applied device design/fabrication and applied clinical learning experiences; to prepare its graduates to carry out effectively the expanding responsibilities of orthotists and prosthetists as health care providers practicing in environments ranging from clinical care to research and device design and development. Students who enter the program will have strong but diverse academic backgrounds reflecting their abilities to think creatively and independently, evaluate critically and systematically, and exercise good judgment. Additionally, students in the program should display the personal qualities of flexibility, responsibility, and sensitivity to others.Admission RequirementsThe Master of Science in Orthotics and Prostheticsprogram admits students by a selective admissions process to begin matriculation in the springsemester only.Students apply to the Master of Science in Orthotics and Prosthetics program through theOrthotics and Prosthetics Centralized Application Service (OPCAS).The program begins in the spring term (January).
