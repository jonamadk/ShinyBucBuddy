Anything that can be touched, tasted, smelled, seen, or felt is made of chemicals. Chemists are the people who transform the everyday materials around us into amazing things. Some chemists work on cures for cancer while others monitor the ozone layer protecting us from the sun. Still others discover new materials to make our homes warmer in the winter, or new textiles to be used in the latest fashions. There are a multitude of careers available to chemists including positions in industry, academics, government, and medical careers.The ACS Chemistry concentration is designed for students who intend to follow a career in the field of chemistry or who intend to enter a graduate program in this science. The curriculum is based on the recommendations of, and is approved by, the American Chemical Society (ACS).

        "document_content": "Major - Chemistry Major, B.S. and Pharmacy 3 + 1 Program - Course and Degree Requirements - Program Information The 3+1 Chemistry and Pharmacy Program allows students to complete a BS in Chemistry while also starting study toward the Doctor of Pharmacy. Those admitted into the program will take general education, chemistry, and other science courses during their first three years at ETSU that will prepare them for admission into the Gatton College of Pharmacy. Upon successful completion of the required first year pharmacy courses, the student will receive a BS in Chemistry (Chemistry Concentration). Admission Requirements Students in the 3+1 degree program must meet admission requirements for and apply to the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program following the normal application process as detailed on the College of Pharmacy webpage ( https://www.etsu.edu/pharmacy/prospective_students/ ). Students may be in the process of completing pharmacy prerequisite courses at the time of application, but must complete them by the end of the spring semester preceding matriculation in the fall semester. Students will be encouraged to apply for Early Decision, the deadline for which is the first Monday of September for the admission cycle (July 1-March 1). Thisassures students will receive an admissions decision by mid-October, which will facilitate their ability to implement an alternative plan should the decision be negative. Advising Students pursuing the 3+1 degree option will be advised through the normal advising process for Chemistry majors. The GCOP Assistant Director for Enrollment will providesecondary advisement relative to preparation for pharmacy school. The GCOP advisor will meet with students each semester; the intent is to provide students with ongoing assessment of their likelihood for admission to GCOP. In addition, students will be encouraged to participate in the ETSU Pre-Pharmacy Student Organization, advised by a GCOP faculty member. Students deemed non-competitive for admission to GCOP will be referred to Chemistry major advisors to develop an alternative plan to earn the B.S. in Chemistry degree. 3+1 Chemistry and Pharmacy Program Requirements: 120 credits Compass Core Curriculum 42 credits Chemistry Major Core 14 credits Concentration Requirements 11 credits Additional Required Courses 8-10 credits Free Electives 1-4 credits 3+1 Pre-Pharmacy Requirements 19-20 credits Pharmacy Year 1 Requirements 22 credits TOTAL 120 credits Suggested Four-Year Program of Study: 3 + 1 Chemistry and Pharmacy Program Compass Core Curriculum These requirements include earning 40-43 credits in Strengthening Foundations, Understanding Natural and Social Worlds, Exploring Connections, Cultivate Artistic Awareness, and Growing as an Individual and Global Citizen categories.

These applications include but not limited to: real-time graphics simulations, distributed systems, and operating systems. It will also be an asset for those students who are planning for graduate work in computer science. The CS concentration supplements the computing core curriculum with courses in data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, and operating systems. The concentration also requires additional credits of mathematics and science, including the calculus sequence required of mathematics majors and one additional lab science.The Bachelors of Science in Computing with a Concentration in Computer Scienceis accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET,www.abet.org,under the General Criteria and the Computer Science Program Criteriaand Similarly Named Computing Programs Program Criteria.Grade Requirement PolicyFor satisfactory progression in the major or minor, the student must attain:An overall GPA of 2.5 or better; andA GPA of 2.5 or better in all computing courses; andA grade of B- or better inCSCI 1250andCSCI 1260.A grade of \u201cC-\u201d or better in all other major requirements. This includes both common core and concentration-specific courses and all courses from other departments that satisfy major requirements.A minimum grade of \u201cC\u201d inENGL 1010andENGL 1020.All computing majors or minors may attempt CSCI courses a maximum of three times. An attempt is defined as registering for and remaining in a class until the last day to drop the course without a \u2018W grade as specified in the Academic Calendar. (Earning a grade in the class, including W or WF, counts as an attempt.)If a student, following a third attempt to take a given course, fails to earn a grade that meets the Departments standard for minimal performance in that course as specified in the Catalog, the student will be barred from further opportunity to enroll in that class. If this class is integral to that students current program of study, the student will be required to change his/her program of study. Depending on the course, this may disqualify the student from continuing in a minor; in one or more concentrations; or in the major.A student may file an appeal with the Chair of the Department of Computing requesting a fourth attempt to take a course.Such an appeal can only be made once by a student concerning any and all CSCI courses.All concentrations must complete 124 credits, including the ETSU General Education Requirements, the common computing core, and the concentration-specific courses.CISC majors must pass the proficiency exam or completeCSCI 1100 - Using Information Technologyprior to accumulating 30 credits.Graduation PolicyGraduation Requirement:Students must successfully completethe Computing Senior Exam (CSE) before graduation. Students are eligible to complete the CSE during the studentslast semester at East Tennessee State University. The CSE is administered in-person within the Testing Centeron ETSUs main campus, at approved off-campus instructional sites, or other department-approved locations.
