Students may also choose one of three capstone options: a group software development project, an individual (independent) computing project, or a traditional thesis.Graduate Admission CriteriaIn addition to admission policies established by the Graduate School,all applicantsare required to submit the following:Undergraduate transcripts that show the equivalent of a major in a computing field with an overall GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Three letters of recommendationthat evaluate the applicants academic ability, professional maturity, and communication skills.A personal essaythat discusses the applicants reason for pursuing the M.S. in Computer Science.Acurriculum vita, detailing any IT-related work experience.In addition to the criteria above,international applicantsmustdemonstrateEnglish proficiencyas specified by Graduate SchoolAdmission Policies.Applicants will be evaluated for admission based on evidence of preparedness for graduate study in computer science, as attested to by academic performance and/or professional experience. Applicants without sufficient academic or professional experience may be admitted provisionally. Applicants lacking academic preparation may be required to complete (with a B- or higher in each course) undergraduate foundation courses in computer science and mathematics. Related professional experience, such as programming, systems analysis, and/or systems design, may be substituted for some foundation courses. Applicants who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted provisionally and must complete their first 9 credit hours in the program of study with a grade of B or higher in each course.Minimum M.S. Degree RequirementsDuring the period before candidacy, graduate students are advised by the departmental graduate coordinator or his designee. By the beginning of the second semester students should form their graduate advisory committee. The committees chair becomes the students primary advisor. The faculty member who directs the non-thesis students software development project serves as the students primary advisor and chair of the committee. Where choices exist, students will decide, in consultation with their advisor, which courses to take to complete the master of science degree.For students in a thesis option, the chair of the students graduate advisory committee directs the research and the preparation of the thesis. After selecting a topic, the student, in consultation with the students advisory committee chair, must develop a thesis proposal and plan which must be presented to the graduate faculty and approved by the students committee. The approval form must bear the signatures of the student and the advisory committee members. The student must orally present and defend the thesis.Advisory Committee- Students should have this committee formed at the beginning of the second semester in which coursework is taken. Students may not apply for candidacy for a graduate degree until the committee has been formed.Admission to Candidacy- To be admitted to candidacy a student must meet a number of requirements of the Graduate School (SeeDegree and Graduation Requirements).Courses Open to Graduate Students- Graduate-level courses are listed at the 5XXX level. Courses at the 4XX7-5XX7 level are subject to special rules concerning enrollment and applicability as electives. Students who desire graduate credit for a course that is offered at both levels must register at the 5XX7 level. Students who wish to count a 5XX7 course as an elective should check with the graduate coordinator about that courses standing before enrolling: courses that are not explicitly listed as possible electives are treated on a case-by-case basis, and some are not eligible to be counted as electives. A course taken for undergraduate-level credit (4XX7 level) cannot be repeated for graduate credit (5XX7 level). Graduate students who are registered for a 5XX7 level course are required to do additional work over and above that required for students registered at the 4XX7 level. At most, 30 percent of all credit-hours which are applicable to a masters program may be in courses at the 5XX7 level. Non-degree students who desire graduate credit may enroll for courses at the 5XXX level with consent of the instructor.Independent Study- No more than one independent study course (1-3 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate program coordinator.Special Topics- No more than two special topics courses (1-6 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate coordinator.Prerequisites for Graduate Study in Computer Science:Students must satisfy the program admission requirements (seeGraduate Admissions Criteriaabove). The foundation coursework includes the following:A background in mathematics including probability and statistics, discrete structures, and for the applied computer science concentration basic calculus.Computer programming, including problem analysis, algorithm, synthesis, and competence in data structures, with knowledge of a high level programming language and for the applied computer science concentration assembly language.Undergraduate-level coursework in database management systems. The applied computer science concentration requires additional work in file processing, computer architecture, and operating systems. The information technology track requires additional coursework in networking and web programming.Some graduate courses have additional or special prerequisites.Applied Computer Science ConcentrationThe Applied Computer Science Concentration is oriented toward advanced computer science concepts and theory in a practical and applied manner. The program teaches advanced operating systems concepts through distributed systems while deepening the students understanding of networking. Students also explore various algorithms by conducting theoretical analysis and implementing algorithms related to artificial intelligence.Computer Science, M.S.

Students may also choose one of three capstone options: a group software development project, an individual (independent) computing project, or a traditional thesis.Graduate Admission CriteriaIn addition to admission policies established by the Graduate School,all applicantsare required to submit the following:Undergraduate transcripts that show the equivalent of a major in a computing field with an overall GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Three letters of recommendationthat evaluate the applicants academic ability, professional maturity, and communication skills.A personal essaythat discusses the applicants reason for pursuing the M.S. in Computer Science.Acurriculum vita, detailing any IT-related work experience.In addition to the criteria above,international applicantsmustdemonstrateEnglish proficiencyas specified by Graduate SchoolAdmission Policies.Applicants will be evaluated for admission based on evidence of preparedness for graduate study in computer science, as attested to by academic performance and/or professional experience. Applicants without sufficient academic or professional experience may be admitted provisionally. Applicants lacking academic preparation may be required to complete (with a B- or higher in each course) undergraduate foundation courses in computer science and mathematics. Related professional experience, such as programming, systems analysis, and/or systems design, may be substituted for some foundation courses. Applicants who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted provisionally and must complete their first 9 credit hours in the program of study with a grade of B or higher in each course.Minimum M.S. Degree RequirementsDuring the period before candidacy, graduate students are advised by the departmental graduate coordinator or his designee. By the beginning of the second semester students should form their graduate advisory committee. The committees chair becomes the students primary advisor. The faculty member who directs the non-thesis students software development project serves as the students primary advisor and chair of the committee. Where choices exist, students will decide, in consultation with their advisor, which courses to take to complete the master of science degree.For students in a thesis option, the chair of the students graduate advisory committee directs the research and the preparation of the thesis. After selecting a topic, the student, in consultation with the students advisory committee chair, must develop a thesis proposal and plan which must be presented to the graduate faculty and approved by the students committee. The approval form must bear the signatures of the student and the advisory committee members. The student must orally present and defend the thesis.Advisory Committee- Students should have this committee formed at the beginning of the second semester in which coursework is taken. Students may not apply for candidacy for a graduate degree until the committee has been formed.Admission to Candidacy- To be admitted to candidacy a student must meet a number of requirements of the Graduate School (SeeDegree and Graduation Requirements).Courses Open to Graduate Students- Graduate-level courses are listed at the 5XXX level. Courses at the 4XX7-5XX7 level are subject to special rules concerning enrollment and applicability as electives. Students who desire graduate credit for a course that is offered at both levels must register at the 5XX7 level. Students who wish to count a 5XX7 course as an elective should check with the graduate coordinator about that courses standing before enrolling: courses that are not explicitly listed as possible electives are treated on a case-by-case basis, and some are not eligible to be counted as electives. A course taken for undergraduate-level credit (4XX7 level) cannot be repeated for graduate credit (5XX7 level). Graduate students who are registered for a 5XX7 level course are required to do additional work over and above that required for students registered at the 4XX7 level. At most, 30 percent of all credit-hours which are applicable to a masters program may be in courses at the 5XX7 level. Non-degree students who desire graduate credit may enroll for courses at the 5XXX level with consent of the instructor.Independent Study- No more than one independent study course (1-3 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate program coordinator.Special Topics- No more than two special topics courses (1-6 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate coordinator.Prerequisites for Graduate Study in Computer Science:Students must satisfy the program admission requirements (seeGraduate Admissions Criteriaabove). The foundation coursework includes the following:A background in mathematics including probability and statistics, discrete structures, and for the applied computer science concentration basic calculus.Computer programming, including problem analysis, algorithm, synthesis, and competence in data structures, with knowledge of a high level programming language and for the applied computer science concentration assembly language.Undergraduate-level coursework in database management systems. The applied computer science concentration requires additional work in file processing, computer architecture, and operating systems. The information technology track requires additional coursework in networking and web programming.Some graduate courses have additional or special prerequisites.Software Engineering ConcentrationThe Software Engineering Concentration gives students an in-depth experience in software development lifecycle phases.

These applications include but not limited to: real-time graphics simulations, distributed systems, and operating systems. It will also be an asset for those students who are planning for graduate work in computer science. The CS concentration supplements the computing core curriculum with courses in data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, and operating systems. The concentration also requires additional credits of mathematics and science, including the calculus sequence required of mathematics majors and one additional lab science.The Bachelors of Science in Computing with a Concentration in Computer Scienceis accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET,www.abet.org,under the General Criteria and the Computer Science Program Criteriaand Similarly Named Computing Programs Program Criteria.Grade Requirement PolicyFor satisfactory progression in the major or minor, the student must attain:An overall GPA of 2.5 or better; andA GPA of 2.5 or better in all computing courses; andA grade of B- or better inCSCI 1250andCSCI 1260.A grade of \u201cC-\u201d or better in all other major requirements. This includes both common core and concentration-specific courses and all courses from other departments that satisfy major requirements.A minimum grade of \u201cC\u201d inENGL 1010andENGL 1020.All computing majors or minors may attempt CSCI courses a maximum of three times. An attempt is defined as registering for and remaining in a class until the last day to drop the course without a \u2018W grade as specified in the Academic Calendar. (Earning a grade in the class, including W or WF, counts as an attempt.)If a student, following a third attempt to take a given course, fails to earn a grade that meets the Departments standard for minimal performance in that course as specified in the Catalog, the student will be barred from further opportunity to enroll in that class. If this class is integral to that students current program of study, the student will be required to change his/her program of study. Depending on the course, this may disqualify the student from continuing in a minor; in one or more concentrations; or in the major.A student may file an appeal with the Chair of the Department of Computing requesting a fourth attempt to take a course.Such an appeal can only be made once by a student concerning any and all CSCI courses.All concentrations must complete 124 credits, including the ETSU General Education Requirements, the common computing core, and the concentration-specific courses.CISC majors must pass the proficiency exam or completeCSCI 1100 - Using Information Technologyprior to accumulating 30 credits.Graduation PolicyGraduation Requirement:Students must successfully completethe Computing Senior Exam (CSE) before graduation. Students are eligible to complete the CSE during the studentslast semester at East Tennessee State University. The CSE is administered in-person within the Testing Centeron ETSUs main campus, at approved off-campus instructional sites, or other department-approved locations. Students who do not successfully complete the CSEmust retake the CSE at a time and location designated by the Department and continue to retake the CSE until completion.For more information about completing the CSE, please contact the Departments Academic Advisor.Computing Major, B.S.

These applications include but not limited to: real-time graphics simulations, distributed systems, and operating systems. It will also be an asset for those students who are planning for graduate work in computer science. The CS concentration supplements the computing core curriculum with courses in data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, and operating systems. The concentration also requires additional credits of mathematics and science, including the calculus sequence required of mathematics majors and one additional lab science.The Bachelors of Science in Computing with a Concentration in Computer Scienceis accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET,www.abet.org,under the General Criteria and the Computer Science Program Criteriaand Similarly Named Computing Programs Program Criteria.Grade Requirement PolicyFor satisfactory progression in the major or minor, the student must attain:An overall GPA of 2.5 or better; andA GPA of 2.5 or better in all computing courses; andA grade of B- or better inCSCI 1250andCSCI 1260.A grade of \u201cC-\u201d or better in all other major requirements. This includes both common core and concentration-specific courses and all courses from other departments that satisfy major requirements.A minimum grade of \u201cC\u201d inENGL 1010andENGL 1020.All computing majors or minors may attempt CSCI courses a maximum of three times. An attempt is defined as registering for and remaining in a class until the last day to drop the course without a \u2018W grade as specified in the Academic Calendar. (Earning a grade in the class, including W or WF, counts as an attempt.)If a student, following a third attempt to take a given course, fails to earn a grade that meets the Departments standard for minimal performance in that course as specified in the Catalog, the student will be barred from further opportunity to enroll in that class. If this class is integral to that students current program of study, the student will be required to change his/her program of study. Depending on the course, this may disqualify the student from continuing in a minor; in one or more concentrations; or in the major.A student may file an appeal with the Chair of the Department of Computing requesting a fourth attempt to take a course.Such an appeal can only be made once by a student concerning any and all CSCI courses.All concentrations must complete 124 credits, including the ETSU General Education Requirements, the common computing core, and the concentration-specific courses.CISC majors must pass the proficiency exam or completeCSCI 1100 - Using Information Technologyprior to accumulating 30 credits.Graduation PolicyGraduation Requirement:Students must successfully completethe Computing Senior Exam (CSE) before graduation. Students are eligible to complete the CSE during the studentslast semester at East Tennessee State University. The CSE is administered in-person within the Testing Centeron ETSUs main campus, at approved off-campus instructional sites, or other department-approved locations. Students who do not successfully complete the CSEmust retake the CSE at a time and location designated by the Department and continue to retake the CSE until completion.For more information about completing the CSE, please contact the Departments Academic Advisor.Computing Major, B.S.

If the student does not achieve a 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the conclusion of one probationary semester, the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies and the Associate DeanGraduate Programs in the College of Nursing will determine if the student should be dismissed from graduate study or continued on academic probation. No student will be allowed more than two probationary semesters, whether consecutive or cumulative. At the end of a second probationary semester, a student whose cumulative grade point average is still below 3.0 will be dismissed from graduate study.Students whose performance results in a GPA so far below 3.0 as to make it mathematically impossible to attain an overall GPA of 3.0 after one semester may be subject to dismissal without a probationary term.An incomplete grade (\u201cI\u201d) indicates that the student was passing the course at the end of the semester, but due to circumstances beyond the students control, was unable to complete the course work for which the \u201cI\u201d is assigned. The \u201cI\u201d grade cannot be used to allow a student to do additional work to raise a deficient grade or to repeat a course. An \u201cI\u201d grade must be removed no later than one calendar year from the time the grade is awarded. Students with more than one \u201cI\u201d grade cannot progress in the program. Time extension requests for removal of an \u201cI\u201d grade must be submitted to and approved by the Dean of the School of Graduate Studies before the allotted time expires.

These applications include but not limited to: real-time graphics simulations, distributed systems, and operating systems. It will also be an asset for those students who are planning for graduate work in computer science. The CS concentration supplements the computing core curriculum with courses in data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, and operating systems. The concentration also requires additional credits of mathematics and science, including the calculus sequence required of mathematics majors and one additional lab science.The Bachelors of Science in Computing with a Concentration in Computer Scienceis accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET,www.abet.org,under the General Criteria and the Computer Science Program Criteriaand Similarly Named Computing Programs Program Criteria.Grade Requirement PolicyFor satisfactory progression in the major or minor, the student must attain:An overall GPA of 2.5 or better; andA GPA of 2.5 or better in all computing courses; andA grade of B- or better inCSCI 1250andCSCI 1260.A grade of \u201cC-\u201d or better in all other major requirements. This includes both common core and concentration-specific courses and all courses from other departments that satisfy major requirements.A minimum grade of \u201cC\u201d inENGL 1010andENGL 1020.All computing majors or minors may attempt CSCI courses a maximum of three times. An attempt is defined as registering for and remaining in a class until the last day to drop the course without a \u2018W grade as specified in the Academic Calendar. (Earning a grade in the class, including W or WF, counts as an attempt.)If a student, following a third attempt to take a given course, fails to earn a grade that meets the Departments standard for minimal performance in that course as specified in the Catalog, the student will be barred from further opportunity to enroll in that class. If this class is integral to that students current program of study, the student will be required to change his/her program of study. Depending on the course, this may disqualify the student from continuing in a minor; in one or more concentrations; or in the major.A student may file an appeal with the Chair of the Department of Computing requesting a fourth attempt to take a course.Such an appeal can only be made once by a student concerning any and all CSCI courses.All concentrations must complete 124 credits, including the ETSU General Education Requirements, the common computing core, and the concentration-specific courses.CISC majors must pass the proficiency exam or completeCSCI 1100 - Using Information Technologyprior to accumulating 30 credits.Graduation PolicyGraduation Requirement:Students must successfully completethe Computing Senior Exam (CSE) before graduation. Students are eligible to complete the CSE during the studentslast semester at East Tennessee State University. The CSE is administered in-person within the Testing Centeron ETSUs main campus, at approved off-campus instructional sites, or other department-approved locations. Students who do not successfully complete the CSEmust retake the CSE at a time and location designated by the Department and continue to retake the CSE until completion.For more information about completing the CSE, please contact the Departments Academic Advisor.Computing Major, B.S.

Students may also choose one of three capstone options: a group software development project, an individual (independent) computing project, or a traditional thesis.Graduate Admission CriteriaIn addition to admission policies established by the Graduate School,all applicantsare required to submit the following:Undergraduate transcripts that show the equivalent of a major in a computing field with an overall GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Three letters of recommendationthat evaluate the applicants academic ability, professional maturity, and communication skills.A personal essaythat discusses the applicants reason for pursuing the M.S. in Computer Science.Acurriculum vita, detailing any IT-related work experience.In addition to the criteria above,international applicantsmustdemonstrateEnglish proficiencyas specified by Graduate SchoolAdmission Policies.Applicants will be evaluated for admission based on evidence of preparedness for graduate study in computer science, as attested to by academic performance and/or professional experience. Applicants without sufficient academic or professional experience may be admitted provisionally. Applicants lacking academic preparation may be required to complete (with a B- or higher in each course) undergraduate foundation courses in computer science and mathematics. Related professional experience, such as programming, systems analysis, and/or systems design, may be substituted for some foundation courses. Applicants who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted provisionally and must complete their first 9 credit hours in the program of study with a grade of B or higher in each course.Minimum M.S. Degree RequirementsDuring the period before candidacy, graduate students are advised by the departmental graduate coordinator or his designee. By the beginning of the second semester students should form their graduate advisory committee. The committees chair becomes the students primary advisor.

Research shows that children who are developing \n                                  language typically learn the correct form faster when children hear recasts , but only \n                                  to a point . If an ad \n ult uses recasts too often ( i.e. nagging ) the child may not pay attention to the helpful \u00a0 corrections \n                                     or recasts . In contrast , children with language delays need more recasts to develop \n                                     and learn \n language . \n This study will examine two aspects of recasts : \n Does the recast rate affect children 's learning of irregular past tense verbs ? That \n                                        is , does That matter if children hear 5 , 10 or 15 recasts in 10 minutes ? \n Does recast distribution affect children 's learning of irregular past tense verbs ? \n                                        That is , does That matter if children hear 20 recasts all in 1 session , or across 2 \n                                        or 5 sessions ? \n Dr. Proctor - Williams hopes that the information gained from this study will develop \n                                  an understanding of the best approaches to use recasts in therapy , and how learning \n                                  from recasts by children with language impairment compares to children with typical \n                                  language development . \n The Research Study : \u00a0 The children will be taught 4 made - up verbs , such as bive , which \n                                  have an irregular past tense , such as bove during play with specific toy sets . In \n                                  conversation , when the children use a regular past tense , such as bived , the examiner \n                                  will recast tense with the irregular form .

Students may also choose one of three capstone options: a group software development project, an individual (independent) computing project, or a traditional thesis.Graduate Admission CriteriaIn addition to admission policies established by the Graduate School,all applicantsare required to submit the following:Undergraduate transcripts that show the equivalent of a major in a computing field with an overall GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Three letters of recommendationthat evaluate the applicants academic ability, professional maturity, and communication skills.A personal essaythat discusses the applicants reason for pursuing the M.S. in Computer Science.Acurriculum vita, detailing any IT-related work experience.In addition to the criteria above,international applicantsmustdemonstrateEnglish proficiencyas specified by Graduate SchoolAdmission Policies.Applicants will be evaluated for admission based on evidence of preparedness for graduate study in computer science, as attested to by academic performance and/or professional experience. Applicants without sufficient academic or professional experience may be admitted provisionally. Applicants lacking academic preparation may be required to complete (with a B- or higher in each course) undergraduate foundation courses in computer science and mathematics. Related professional experience, such as programming, systems analysis, and/or systems design, may be substituted for some foundation courses. Applicants who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted provisionally and must complete their first 9 credit hours in the program of study with a grade of B or higher in each course.Minimum M.S. Degree RequirementsDuring the period before candidacy, graduate students are advised by the departmental graduate coordinator or his designee. By the beginning of the second semester students should form their graduate advisory committee. The committees chair becomes the students primary advisor. The faculty member who directs the non-thesis students software development project serves as the students primary advisor and chair of the committee. Where choices exist, students will decide, in consultation with their advisor, which courses to take to complete the master of science degree.For students in a thesis option, the chair of the students graduate advisory committee directs the research and the preparation of the thesis. After selecting a topic, the student, in consultation with the students advisory committee chair, must develop a thesis proposal and plan which must be presented to the graduate faculty and approved by the students committee. The approval form must bear the signatures of the student and the advisory committee members. The student must orally present and defend the thesis.Advisory Committee- Students should have this committee formed at the beginning of the second semester in which coursework is taken. Students may not apply for candidacy for a graduate degree until the committee has been formed.Admission to Candidacy- To be admitted to candidacy a student must meet a number of requirements of the Graduate School (SeeDegree and Graduation Requirements).Courses Open to Graduate Students- Graduate-level courses are listed at the 5XXX level. Courses at the 4XX7-5XX7 level are subject to special rules concerning enrollment and applicability as electives. Students who desire graduate credit for a course that is offered at both levels must register at the 5XX7 level. Students who wish to count a 5XX7 course as an elective should check with the graduate coordinator about that courses standing before enrolling: courses that are not explicitly listed as possible electives are treated on a case-by-case basis, and some are not eligible to be counted as electives. A course taken for undergraduate-level credit (4XX7 level) cannot be repeated for graduate credit (5XX7 level). Graduate students who are registered for a 5XX7 level course are required to do additional work over and above that required for students registered at the 4XX7 level. At most, 30 percent of all credit-hours which are applicable to a masters program may be in courses at the 5XX7 level. Non-degree students who desire graduate credit may enroll for courses at the 5XXX level with consent of the instructor.Independent Study- No more than one independent study course (1-3 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate program coordinator.Special Topics- No more than two special topics courses (1-6 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate coordinator.Prerequisites for Graduate Study in Computer Science:Students must satisfy the program admission requirements (seeGraduate Admissions Criteriaabove). The foundation coursework includes the following:A background in mathematics including probability and statistics, discrete structures, and for the applied computer science concentration basic calculus.Computer programming, including problem analysis, algorithm, synthesis, and competence in data structures, with knowledge of a high level programming language and for the applied computer science concentration assembly language.Undergraduate-level coursework in database management systems. The applied computer science concentration requires additional work in file processing, computer architecture, and operating systems. The information technology track requires additional coursework in networking and web programming.Some graduate courses have additional or special prerequisites.Applied Computer Science ConcentrationThe Applied Computer Science Concentration is oriented toward advanced computer science concepts and theory in a practical and applied manner. The program teaches advanced operating systems concepts through distributed systems while deepening the students understanding of networking. Students also explore various algorithms by conducting theoretical analysis and implementing algorithms related to artificial intelligence.Computer Science, M.S.

Students may also choose one of three capstone options: a group software development project, an individual (independent) computing project, or a traditional thesis.Graduate Admission CriteriaIn addition to admission policies established by the Graduate School,all applicantsare required to submit the following:Undergraduate transcripts that show the equivalent of a major in a computing field with an overall GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Three letters of recommendationthat evaluate the applicants academic ability, professional maturity, and communication skills.A personal essaythat discusses the applicants reason for pursuing the M.S. in Computer Science.Acurriculum vita, detailing any IT-related work experience.In addition to the criteria above,international applicantsmustdemonstrateEnglish proficiencyas specified by Graduate SchoolAdmission Policies.Applicants will be evaluated for admission based on evidence of preparedness for graduate study in computer science, as attested to by academic performance and/or professional experience. Applicants without sufficient academic or professional experience may be admitted provisionally. Applicants lacking academic preparation may be required to complete (with a B- or higher in each course) undergraduate foundation courses in computer science and mathematics. Related professional experience, such as programming, systems analysis, and/or systems design, may be substituted for some foundation courses. Applicants who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted provisionally and must complete their first 9 credit hours in the program of study with a grade of B or higher in each course.Minimum M.S. Degree RequirementsDuring the period before candidacy, graduate students are advised by the departmental graduate coordinator or his designee. By the beginning of the second semester students should form their graduate advisory committee. The committees chair becomes the students primary advisor. The faculty member who directs the non-thesis students software development project serves as the students primary advisor and chair of the committee. Where choices exist, students will decide, in consultation with their advisor, which courses to take to complete the master of science degree.For students in a thesis option, the chair of the students graduate advisory committee directs the research and the preparation of the thesis. After selecting a topic, the student, in consultation with the students advisory committee chair, must develop a thesis proposal and plan which must be presented to the graduate faculty and approved by the students committee. The approval form must bear the signatures of the student and the advisory committee members. The student must orally present and defend the thesis.Advisory Committee- Students should have this committee formed at the beginning of the second semester in which coursework is taken. Students may not apply for candidacy for a graduate degree until the committee has been formed.Admission to Candidacy- To be admitted to candidacy a student must meet a number of requirements of the Graduate School (SeeDegree and Graduation Requirements).Courses Open to Graduate Students- Graduate-level courses are listed at the 5XXX level. Courses at the 4XX7-5XX7 level are subject to special rules concerning enrollment and applicability as electives. Students who desire graduate credit for a course that is offered at both levels must register at the 5XX7 level. Students who wish to count a 5XX7 course as an elective should check with the graduate coordinator about that courses standing before enrolling: courses that are not explicitly listed as possible electives are treated on a case-by-case basis, and some are not eligible to be counted as electives. A course taken for undergraduate-level credit (4XX7 level) cannot be repeated for graduate credit (5XX7 level). Graduate students who are registered for a 5XX7 level course are required to do additional work over and above that required for students registered at the 4XX7 level. At most, 30 percent of all credit-hours which are applicable to a masters program may be in courses at the 5XX7 level. Non-degree students who desire graduate credit may enroll for courses at the 5XXX level with consent of the instructor.Independent Study- No more than one independent study course (1-3 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate program coordinator.Special Topics- No more than two special topics courses (1-6 hours) may be taken for credit toward a graduate degree without special written approval of the graduate coordinator.Prerequisites for Graduate Study in Computer Science:Students must satisfy the program admission requirements (seeGraduate Admissions Criteriaabove). The foundation coursework includes the following:A background in mathematics including probability and statistics, discrete structures, and for the applied computer science concentration basic calculus.Computer programming, including problem analysis, algorithm, synthesis, and competence in data structures, with knowledge of a high level programming language and for the applied computer science concentration assembly language.Undergraduate-level coursework in database management systems. The applied computer science concentration requires additional work in file processing, computer architecture, and operating systems. The information technology track requires additional coursework in networking and web programming.Some graduate courses have additional or special prerequisites.Software Engineering ConcentrationThe Software Engineering Concentration gives students an in-depth experience in software development lifecycle phases. Topics in requirements engineering, software design and design patterns, software testing, and setting up software production pipelines are covered.Computer Science, M.S.

Students may also choose one of three capstone options: a group software development project, an individual (independent) computing project, or a traditional thesis.Graduate Admission CriteriaIn addition to admission policies established by the Graduate School,all applicantsare required to submit the following:Undergraduate transcripts that show the equivalent of a major in a computing field with an overall GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale.Three letters of recommendationthat evaluate the applicants academic ability, professional maturity, and communication skills.A personal essaythat discusses the applicants reason for pursuing the M.S. in Computer Science.Acurriculum vita, detailing any IT-related work experience.In addition to the criteria above,international applicantsmustdemonstrateEnglish proficiencyas specified by Graduate SchoolAdmission Policies.Applicants will be evaluated for admission based on evidence of preparedness for graduate study in computer science, as attested to by academic performance and/or professional experience. Applicants without sufficient academic or professional experience may be admitted provisionally. Applicants lacking academic preparation may be required to complete (with a B- or higher in each course) undergraduate foundation courses in computer science and mathematics. Related professional experience, such as programming, systems analysis, and/or systems design, may be substituted for some foundation courses. Applicants who do not meet the GPA requirement may be admitted provisionally and must complete their first 9 credit hours in the program of study with a grade of B or higher in each course.Minimum M.S. Degree RequirementsDuring the period before candidacy, graduate students are advised by the departmental graduate coordinator or his designee. By the beginning of the second semester students should form their graduate advisory committee. The committees chair becomes the students primary advisor. The faculty member who directs the non-thesis students software development project serves as the students primary advisor and chair of the committee. Where choices exist, students will decide, in consultation with their advisor, which courses to take to complete the master of science degree.For students in a thesis option, the chair of the students graduate advisory committee directs the research and the preparation of the thesis. After selecting a topic, the student, in consultation with the students advisory committee chair, must develop a thesis proposal and plan which must be presented to the graduate faculty and approved by the students committee. The approval form must bear the signatures of the student and the advisory committee members. The student must orally present and defend the thesis.Advisory Committee- Students should have this committee formed at the beginning of the second semester in which coursework is taken.
